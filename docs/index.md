# Introduction

_OntoGPT_ is a Python package for extracting structured information from text with large language models (LLMs), _instruction prompts_, and ontology-based grounding. It works well with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models as well as a selection of other LLMs. OntoGPT's output can be used for general-purpose natural language tasks (e.g., named entity recognition and relation extraction), summarization, knowledge base and knowledge graph construction, and more.

## Methods

Two different strategies for knowledge extraction are currently implemented in OntoGPT:

* SPIRES: *Structured Prompt Interrogation and Recursive Extraction of Semantics*
  * A Zero-shot learning (ZSL) approach to extracting nested semantic structures from text
  * This approach takes two inputs - 1) LinkML schema 2) free text, and outputs knowledge in a structure conformant with the supplied schema in JSON, YAML, RDF or OWL formats
  * Uses GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, or one of a variety of open LLMs on your local machine
* SPINDOCTOR: *Structured Prompt Interpolation of Narrative Descriptions Or Controlled Terms for Ontological Reporting*
  * Summarizes gene set descriptions (pseudo gene-set enrichment)
  * Uses GPT-3.5-turbo or GPT-4

## Quick Start

Please see the Setup page on the left for more detailed instructions.

OntoGPT runs on the command line, though there's also a minimal web app interface (see `Web Application` section below).

1. Ensure you have Python 3.9 or greater installed.
2. Install with `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install ontogpt
    ```

3. Set your OpenAI API key:

    ```bash
    runoak set-apikey -e openai <your openai api key>
    ```

4. See the list of all OntoGPT commands:

    ```bash
    ontogpt --help
    ```

5. Try a simple example of information extraction:

    ```bash
    echo "One treatment for high blood pressure is carvedilol." > example.txt
    ontogpt extract -i example.txt -t drug
    ```

    OntoGPT will retrieve the necessary ontologies and output results to the command line. Your output will provide all extracted objects under the heading `extracted_object`.

## Web Application

There is a bare bones web application for running OntoGPT and viewing results.

First, install the required dependencies with `pip` by running the following command:

```bash
pip install ontogpt[web]
```

Then run this command to start the web application:

```bash
web-ontogpt
```

NOTE: We do not recommend hosting this webapp publicly without authentication.

## Features

### Define your own extraction model using LinkML

There are a number of pre-defined LinkML data models already developed here - [src/ontogpt/templates/](src/ontogpt/templates/) which you can use as reference when creating your own data models.

Define a schema (using a subset of [LinkML](https://linkml.io)) that describes the structure in which you want to extract knowledge from your text.

An example:

```yaml
classes:
  MendelianDisease:
    attributes:
      name:
        description: the name of the disease
        examples:
          - value: peroxisome biogenesis disorder
        identifier: true  ## needed for inlining
      description:
        description: a description of the disease
        examples:
          - value: >-
            Peroxisome biogenesis disorders, Zellweger syndrome spectrum (PBD-ZSS) is a group of autosomal recessive disorders affecting the formation of functional peroxisomes, characterized by sensorineural hearing loss, pigmentary retinal degeneration, multiple organ dysfunction and psychomotor impairment
      synonyms:
        multivalued: true
        examples:
          - value: Zellweger syndrome spectrum
          - value: PBD-ZSS
      subclass_of:
        multivalued: true
        range: MendelianDisease
        examples:
          - value: lysosomal disease
          - value: autosomal recessive disorder
      symptoms:
        range: Symptom
        multivalued: true
        examples:
          - value: sensorineural hearing loss
          - value: pigmentary retinal degeneration
      inheritance:
        range: Inheritance
        examples:
          - value: autosomal recessive
      genes:
        range: Gene
        multivalued: true
        examples:
          - value: PEX1
          - value: PEX2
          - value: PEX3

  Gene:
    is_a: NamedThing
    id_prefixes:
      - HGNC
    annotations:
      annotators: gilda:, bioportal:hgnc-nr

  Symptom:
    is_a: NamedThing
    id_prefixes:
      - HP
    annotations:
      annotators: sqlite:obo:hp

  Inheritance:
    is_a: NamedThing
    annotations:
      annotators: sqlite:obo:hp
```

* Prompt hints can be specified using the `prompt` annotation (otherwise description is used)
* Multivalued fields are supported
* The default range is string — these are not grounded. Ex.: disease name, synonyms
* Define a class for each `NamedEntity`
* For any `NamedEntity`, you can specify a preferred annotator using the `annotators` annotation

We recommend following an established schema like [BioLink Model](https://github.com/biolink/biolink-model), but you can define your own.

Next step is to compile the schema. For that, you should place the schema YAML in the directory [src/ontogpt/templates/](src/ontogpt/templates/). Then, run the `make` command at the top level. This will compile the schema to Python (Pydantic classes).

Once you have defined your own schema / data model and placed in the correct directory, you can run the `extract` command.

Ex.:

```bash
ontogpt extract -t mendelian_disease.MendelianDisease -i marfan-wikipedia.txt
```

### Multiple levels of nesting

Currently no more than two levels of nesting are recommended.

If a field has a range which is itself a class and not a primitive, it will attempt to nest.

Ex. the `gocam` schema has an attribute:

```yaml
  attributes:
      ...
      gene_functions:
        description: semicolon-separated list of gene to molecular activity relationships
        multivalued: true
        range: GeneMolecularActivityRelationship
```

The range `GeneMolecularActivityRelationship` has been specified _inline_, so it will nest.

The generated prompt is:

```bash
gene_functions : <semicolon-separated list of gene to molecular activities relationships>
```

The output of this is then passed through further SPIRES iterations.

### Text length limit

LLMs have context sizes limiting the combined length of their inputs and outputs. The `gpt-3.5-turbo` model, for example, has a 4,096 token limit (prompt + completion), while the `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k` model has a larger context of 16,384 tokens.

### Schema tips

It helps to have an understanding of the [LinkML](https://linkml.io) schema language, but it should be possible to define your own schemas using the examples in [src/ontogpt/templates](src/ontogpt/templates/) as a guide.

OntoGPT-specific extensions are specified as _annotations_.

You can specify a set of annotators for a field using the `annotators` annotation.

Ex.:

```yaml
  Gene:
    is_a: NamedThing
    id_prefixes:
      - HGNC
    annotations:
      annotators: gilda:, bioportal:hgnc-nr, obo:pr
```

The annotators are applied in order.

Additionally, when performing grounding, the following measures can be taken to improve accuracy:

* Specify the valid set of ID prefixes using `id_prefixes`
* Some vocabularies have structural IDs that are amenable to regexes, you can specify these using `pattern`
* You can make use of `values_from` slot to specify a [Dynamic Value Set](https://linkml.io/linkml/schemas/enums.html#dynamic-enums)
  * For example, you can constrain the set of valid locations for a gene product to be subclasses of `cellular_component` in GO or `cell` in CL

Ex.:

```yaml
classes:
  ...
  GeneLocation:
    is_a: NamedEntity
    id_prefixes:
      - GO
      - CL
    annotations:
      annotators: "sqlite:obo:go, sqlite:obo:cl"
    slot_usage:
      id:
        values_from:
          - GOCellComponentType
          - CellType

enums:
  GOCellComponentType:
    reachable_from:
      source_ontology: obo:go
      source_nodes:
        - GO:0005575 ## cellular_component
  CellType:
    reachable_from:
      source_ontology: obo:cl
      source_nodes:
        - CL:0000000 ## cell
```

### OWL Exports

The `extract` command will let you export the results as OWL axioms, utilizing [linkml-owl](https://linkml.io/linkml-owl) mappings in the schema.

Ex.:

```bash
ontogpt extract -t recipe -i recipe-spaghetti.txt -o recipe-spaghetti.owl -O owl
```

[src/ontogpt/templates/recipe.yaml](src/ontogpt/templates/recipe.yaml) is an example schema that uses linkml-owl mappings.

See the [Makefile](Makefile) for a full pipeline that involves using robot to extract a subset of FOODON
and merge in the extracted results. This uses [recipe-scrapers](https://github.com/hhursev/recipe-scrapers).

OWL output: [recipe-all-merged.owl](tests/output/owl/merged/recipe-all-merged.owl)

Classification:

![OWL in the Protege editor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50745/230427663-20d845e9-f1d5-490e-b1ad-cdccdd0dca70.png "OWL in the Protege editor")

## Web Application Setup

There is a bare bones web application for running OntoGPT and viewing results.

Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
poetry install -E web
```

Then run this command to start the web application:

```bash
poetry run web-ontogpt
```

Note: The agent running uvicorn must have the API key set, so for obvious reasons don't host this publicly without authentication, unless you want your credits drained.

### SPINDOCTOR web app

To start:

```bash
poetry run streamlit run src/ontogpt/streamlit/spindoctor.py
```

### HuggingFace Hub

Note: support for HuggingFace-provided models is currently a work in progress.

A select number of LLMs may be accessed through HuggingFace Hub. See the full list using `ontogpt list-models`

Specify a model name with the `-m` option.

Example:

```bash
ontogpt extract -t mendelian_disease.MendelianDisease -i tests/input/cases/mendelian-disease-sly.txt -m FLAN_T5_BASE
```
