Plants live in association with microorganisms that positively influence plant
development, vigor, and fitness in response to pathogens and abiotic stressors.
The bulk of the plant microbiome is concentrated belowground at the plant rootsoil
interface. Plant roots secrete carbon-rich rhizodeposits containing primary and
secondary low molecular weight metabolites, lysates, and mucilages. These exudates
provide nutrients for soil microorganisms and modulate their affinity to host plants, but
molecular details of this process are largely unresolved. We addressed this gap by
focusing on the molecular dialog between eight well-characterized beneficial strains
of the Pseudomonas fluorescens group and Brachypodium distachyon, a model for
economically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops of the grass family. We
collected and analyzed root exudates of B. distachyon and demonstrated the presence
of multiple carbohydrates, amino acids, organic acids, and phenolic compounds. The
subsequent screening of bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays revealed that many
of these metabolites provide carbon and energy for the Pseudomonas strains. RNAseq
profiling of bacterial cultures amended with root exudates revealed changes in the
expression of genes encoding numerous catabolic and anabolic enzymes, transporters,
transcriptional regulators, stress response, and conserved hypothetical proteins. Almost
half of the differentially expressed genes mapped to the variable part of the strains’
pangenome, reflecting the importance of the variable gene content in the adaptation of
P. fluorescens to the rhizosphere lifestyle. Our results collectively reveal the diversity
of cellular pathways and physiological responses underlying the establishment of
mutualistic interactions between these beneficial rhizobacteria and their plant hosts.

INTRODUCTION
Plants are meta-organisms or holobionts that rely in part on
their microbiome for specific functions and traits. The ability
of the plant microbiome to influence plant development, vigor,
health, and fitness in response to abiotic stressors associated
with global climate change is documented by numerous studies
(Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009). There is mounting evidence
that plants actively recruit beneficial microbiomes, but many
aspects of this process are still very much a black box (Reinhold-
Hurek et al., 2015). The foundation for the differential affinity
of rhizobacteria toward host plants is built upon complex
chemical cross talk between microorganisms and plant roots.
Up to 40% of photosynthetically fixed carbon is released by
plant roots in the form of exudates and secretions, lysates, and
mucilages (Curl and Truelove, 1986; Lynch, 1990; Whipps, 1990;
Badri and Vivanco, 2009). The release of these compounds is
actively controlled in response to environmental stimuli, and the
composition of root exudates varies greatly according to plant
species and physiological condition (Lynch, 1990; Nguyen, 2003;
Phillips et al., 2004; De-la-Pena et al., 2008). The presence and
composition of exudates strongly impact soil microorganisms,
which is consistent with the idea that plants actively select and
shape their root microbiota (Zolla et al., 2013).
Primary root exudates include simple and complex sugars,
amino acids, polypeptides and proteins, organic, aliphatic and
fatty acids, sterols, and phenolics (Nguyen, 2003; Badri and
Vivanco, 2009; Badri et al., 2009). These compounds serve as
carbon and energy sources for rhizobacteria, and the presence
of the intact corresponding catabolic pathways is essential
for competitive colonization of roots and disease suppression
(Lugtenberg et al., 2001; Kamilova et al., 2005; Lugtenberg and
Kamilova, 2009). Root exudates also contain numerous signal
molecules and secondary metabolites, the significance of which
is only now emerging (Walker et al., 2003; Bais et al., 2005,
2006). A handful of analyses of plant-induced gene expression
by transcriptional profiling in vitro (Mark et al., 2005) or in
the rhizosphere (Silby and Levy, 2004; Ramos-Gonzalez et al.,
2005; Matilla et al., 2007; Barret et al., 2009) have identified
multiple genes that are differentially regulated by exposure to
roots or root exudates. Bacterial pathways expressed during
rhizosphere colonization control utilization of plant-derived
metabolites (Simons et al., 1996, 1997; Camacho-Carvajal, 2001;
Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), motility and chemotaxis (de
Weert et al., 2002; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), phase
variation (Dekkers et al., 1998; Sanchez-Contreras et al., 2002;
van den Broek et al., 2005), outer membrane integrity (de Weert
et al., 2006; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), and the ability
to sequester limiting resources (Raaijmakers et al., 1995) and
resist environmental stresses (Sarniguet et al., 1995; Miller and
Wood, 1996; van Veen et al., 1997; Schnider-Keel et al., 2001). In
its spatial and temporal properties, root colonization resembles
biofilm formation, and biofilm-related pathways also have been
implicated in adhesion to seeds and roots and rhizosphere
colonization (Espinosa-Urgel et al., 2000; Hinsa et al., 2003;
Yousef-Coronado et al., 2008; Fuqua, 2010; Martinez-Gil et al.,
2010; Nielsen et al., 2011; Zboralski and Filion, 2020). Finally,
root exudates strongly affect the expression of diverse plant
growth promotion and biocontrol genes (Vacheron et al., 2013).
Over the past decade, the genomes of numerous rhizosphere
strains have been sequenced and analyzed, but functional
genomics studies of rhizosphere competence lag behind the
availability of sequence data.
This study explored the molecular dialog between the
model host plant Brachypodium distachyon and several wellcharacterized
rhizosphere strains of the Pseudomonas fluorescens
group. Brachypodium is a small annual grass originating in semiarid
regions of the Middle East that has emerged as a prime model
for economically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops
of the grass family (Bevan et al., 2010; Schwartz et al., 2010;
Brkljacic et al., 2011; Hong et al., 2011; Tyler et al., 2014). The
biology, extensive collection of resources, and research tools
make B. distachyon an attractive model to investigate interactions
between plants and root-associated microbes. Pseudomonads
are ubiquitous Gram-negative g-proteobacteria that colonize
eukaryotic hosts and include both commensals and economically
important pathogens of plants and animals (Moore et al.,
2006; Schroth et al., 2006; Yahr and Parsek, 2006). The genus
Pseudomonas currently comprises > 100 named species that have
been separated based on multilocus sequence analysis into 14
species groups (Garrido-Sanz et al., 2016; Hesse et al., 2018).
The P. fluorescens group is the most diverse regarding both
the genetic distances within it, the number of species and the
large pangenome that makes up > 50% of the pangenome
of the genus as a whole (Loper et al., 2012). The group also
encompasses an unusually high proportion of strains that inhabit
the plant rhizosphere and possess plant growth promoting and
biocontrol properties. Naylor et al. (2017) profiled bacterial
communities associated with root tissues and rhizosphere of
18 different plant species of the Poaceae family. That study
identified Pseudomonas among taxa constituting the core grass
root microbiome and demonstrated that these bacteria were
enriched in C3 plants, including wheat, rye, barley, oat, and
Brachypodium. We confirmed the capacity of B. distachyon
Bd21 to serve as a host for rhizobacteria of the P. fluorescens
group in preliminary greenhouse assays with biocontrol strains
P. synxantha 2-79, P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96, and P. protegens
Pf-5. Results of these experiments revealed that all strains
successfully established and colonized the roots of Brachypodium
(Supplementary Table 1).
In this study, we focused on eight well-studied strains
of the P. fluorescens complex that are supported by years
of studies, numerous refereed publications, and high-quality
genome sequences. By profiling transcriptomes of these strains
during growth in root exudates of B. distachyon, we revealed the
diversity of cellular pathways and physiological responses that
underlie the establishment of mutualistic interactions between
beneficial rhizobacteria and the host plant. Our results also
confirmed that root exudates contain carbohydrates, amino acids,
organic acids, and phenolics that serve as carbon and energy
sources for rhizobacteria. The root exudates also contained
osmoprotectants that may help microorganisms to persist in the
rhizosphere of drought-stressed plants. The diversity of microbial
genes perturbed by root exudates reflects the importance of

Pseudomonas to the rhizosphere lifestyle.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial Strains Used in the Study
The eight Pseudomonas strains used for this study are
P. synxantha 2-79 (Thomashow and Weller, 1988), P. fluorescens
SBW25 (Silby et al., 2009), Pseudomonas sp. R1-43-08 (Parejko
et al., 2012), P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96 (Raaijmakers and Weller,
1998), P. fluorescens Q2-87 (Bangera and Thomashow, 1996),
P. chlororaphis 30-84 (Thomashow et al., 1990), P. fluorescens
Pf0-1 (Silby et al., 2009), and P. protegens Pf-5 (Howell and
Stipanovic, 1980). The selected organisms have been studied
extensively for their role in biological control and plant
growth promotion (Supplementary Table 2). The strains were
maintained in the laboratory as frozen stocks (􀀀80 C) and
routinely cultured in King’s medium B (King et al., 1954) or
21C medium, which contained (per 1 L): 1.0 g of NH4Cl, 3.5 g
of Na2HPO4 2H2O, 2.8 g of KH2PO4, 3.0 g of glucose, and
20 ml of a microelement solution (Smibert and Kreig, 1994;
Halverson and Firestone, 2000).
Propagation of Plants and Collection of
Root Exudates
B. distachyon Bd21 was established from seed material obtained
from the USDA-ARS Plant Germplasm Introduction and Testing
Research Unit (Pullman, WA, United States). Brachypodium
seeds were imbibed for 3 days at 4 C and sown in 7   7 cm
pots filled with Sunshine Potting Mix #4 (Sun Gro Horticulture,
Agawam, MA, United States). Plants were grown in an IR-
89X (Percival Scientific, Perry, IA, United States) controlled
environment chamber retrofitted with 6500K and 3000K T5 54W
grow lights (Spectralux) under a 20-h light, 24 C/4-h dark, 18 C
cycle. Plants were watered and fertilized with Jack’s professional
water-soluble fertilizer (20:20:20) (JR Peters, Allentown, PA,
United States). After 12 weeks and plant senescence, seeds
were collected, processed, and stored under desiccant and dark
conditions at room temperature.
To collect root exudates, seeds of B. distachyon Bd21 were
surface-sterilized, pregerminated, and placed in sterile 1 L widemouth
glass jars containing 113 g of 6-mm glass beads and
25 ml distilled water. Jars were covered with vented caps
and plants were grown hydroponically in an environmental
controlled growth chamber under conditions described above.
After 6 days, root exudates were extracted from individual
jars and their sterility was confirmed by spotting on nutrient
agar. Multiple batches of root exudates were collected, filtered
(0.22 mm), aliquoted in Falcon tubes (10 ml), lyophilized, and
stored at –80 C.
Metabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates
Exudates were analyzed for primary metabolites at the Murdock
Metabolomics Laboratory at Washington State University
(Pullman, WA, United States). Freeze-dried residues were
suspended in 500 ml 50% aqueous acetonitrile and clarified by
centrifugation for 20 min at 21,000   g and 4 C. The liquid
chromatography mass spectrometry analysis was conducted
with a Synapt G2-S quadrupole-ion mobility spectrometrytime
of flight mass spectrometer system equipped with an
acquity ultra-performance liquid chromatograph (UPLC) and
an acquity photodiode array detector (all from Waters, Milford,
MA, United States). The exudate metabolites were separated
on a SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC HPLC column (2.1   100 mm,
3 mm) (Milllipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, United States) using
acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid as solvent B and water
with 0.1% formic acid as solvent A at a flow rate of 400 ml
min􀀀1 and the following linear gradient extending over 14 min:
0 min, 80% B; 4 min, 80% B, 6 min: 10% B; 7.5 min, 10%
B; 10 min, 80% B; and 14 min, 80% B. Mass spectra were
collected in positive ion mode over a range of m/z 50–1,200
with a scan time of 0.2 s. The Q-TOF-MS source was at
3.0 kV and 120 C; the sampling cone at 40 V, desolvation
temperature was 250 C; cone gas and desolvation gas flow were
at 0 and 850 L h􀀀1, respectively. Leucine enkephalin was used
for post-acquisition mass correction. Target compounds were
visualized using selected ion chromatograms at 0.05 Da window
width. The compound identification was based on comparison
of chromatographic behavior and accurate masses to those of
authentic standards.
For gas chromatography, derivatization was carried out using
a modification of the procedure of Lee and Fiehn (2008).
The freeze-dried residues were suspended in 950 ml aqueous
methanol (84%, v/v) and clarified by centrifugation for 15 min
at 21,000   g at 4 C. The supernatants were spiked with 1
mg of the internal standard salicylic acid-d6 (C/D/N Isotopes,
Quebec, Canada) and dried in vacuo. The dry residues were
suspended in 10 ml of O-methoxylamine hydrochloride (30 mg
ml􀀀1 in anhydrous pyridine, both from Millipore Sigma) and
incubated while mixing (1,000 RPM) for 90 min at 30 C.
Subsequently, samples were derivatized with 90 ml of MSTFA
with 1% TMCS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,
United States) for 30 min at 37 C. Gas chromatography-mass
spectroscopy analysis was performed using a Pegasus 4D timeof-
flight mass spectrometer (LECO, Saint Joseph MI) equipped
with a MPS2 autosampler (Gerstel, Linthicum, MD) and a 7890A
oven (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States).
The derivatization products were separated on a 30-m, 0.25 mm
i.d., 0.25 mm df Rxi-5Sil column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA,
United States) with an IntegraGuard precolumn using ultrapure
He at a constant flow of 0.9 ml min􀀀1 as carrier gas. The linear
thermal gradient started with a 1-min hold at 70 C, followed
by a ramp to 300 C at 10 C min􀀀1. The final temperature was
held for 5 min prior to returning to initial conditions. Mass
spectra were collected at 17 spectra s􀀀1. Peak identification was
conducted using the Fiehn primary metabolite library (Kind
et al., 2009) and an identity score cutoff of 700. Additionally,
authentic standards for a number of primary metabolites were
analyzed under identical conditions and the data used to compare
the chromatographic behavior. Peak alignment and spectrum
comparisons were carried out using the Statistical Compare
feature of ChromaTOF software (LECO).

Isolation of RNA From Bacteria Cultured
in Root Exudates and RNA-Seq
The strains were pregrown overnight at 25 C on 21C-glucose
agar and then subcultured into 96-well microplates containing
liquid 21C-glucose medium amended with Brachypodium
exudates. The liquid medium was prepared by dissolving the
lyophilized root exudate material in an appropriate volume of
21C-glucose medium to concentrate root exudates 20-fold. The
growth medium was sterilized by passing it through a 0.22-
mm membrane filter. The control cultures were grown under
identical conditions in the absence of exudates. All treatments
were inoculated at OD600 of 0.1 and incubated for 20 to
22 h until cultures entered late-exponential growth phase at
25 C in an atmosphere of 15% oxygen [created by a ProOx
P110 oxygen controller (BioSpherix, Parish, NY, United States)
with a hypoxia C-chamber]. The cells were stabilized by the
addition RNAprotect reagent (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD,
United States) and total RNA was purified using a RNeasy Protect
Bacteria Mini Kit (QIAGEN) from three biological replicates of
each strain cultured under control conditions and in exudates.
The quality assessment of the extracted RNA samples was
performed with a NanoDrop OneC Spectrophotometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) and a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies)
and revealed A260/A280 and A260/A230 values of > 2.0 and a mean
RNA integrity numbers (RIN) value of > 9.2.
Three biological replicates of RNA samples were shipped on
dry ice to the DOE Joint Genome Institute (Walnut Creek, CA,
United States), where rRNA was depleted and stranded RNASeq
libraries were prepared, quantified by qPCR and sequenced
using a HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina). The fastq file reads
were filtered and processed with BBDuk1 to remove reads that
contained 1 or more “N” bases, had an average quality score
across the read less than 10 or had a minimum length < 51 bp
or 33% of the full read length. Reads mapped with BBMap (see
text footnote 2) to masked human, cat, dog, and mouse references
at 93% identity were removed. Another category of removed
sequences matched RNA spike-in, PhiX, common microbial
contaminants, and ribosomal RNAs. The processed reads from
each library were aligned to the reference genome using BBMap
with only unique mappings allowed (BAMs/directory). If a
read mapped to more than one location it was ignored.
featureCounts (Liao et al., 2014) was used to generate raw
gene counts, which were normalized to adjust for the length of
each gene and total number of reads mapped for each library.
The normalization formula used: n = [r/(l/1,000)]/(t/1,000,000),
where n = normalized read count for gene (G) for library (L);
r = raw read count for gene G for library L; l = gene G length; and
t = total reads mapped for library L. Raw gene counts were used to
evaluate the level of correlation between biological samples using
Pearson’s correlation.
Bioinformatic Analysis
Count tables generated by the JGI RNA-Seq pipeline were input
into DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) to normalize and determine
1https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/
differential expression. Statistical significance was established
through DESeq2 by using three biological replicates for control
and root exudate conditions. Scatterplots were generated from
the DESeq2 data table outputs using ggplot2. Genes differentially
expressed between control and root exudate samples (log2 foldchanges
–2   to   2, adjusted p value   0.05) were used in
downstream analysis. The core genome and pangenome for the
Pseudomonas strains used in this study were computed using the
OthoMCL v.2.0, Species Tree Builder v.2.2.0, and Phylogenetic
Pangenome Accumulation v1.4.0 apps implemented in the U.S.
Department of Energy Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase)
(Arkin et al., 2018). Additional comparisons were conducted
with the PGAweb pangenome analysis pipeline (Chen et al.,
2018). Differentially expressed genes were assigned to core,
non-core, and singleton parts of each strain’s proteome by
BLASTp with an E value cutoff of e-06, identity of 40%
and coverage of 60%. Functional annotation of differentially
expressed genes was carried out with the Blast2GO (Conesa
and Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al.,
2018). Additional manual curation was performed using tools
implemented in the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG)
database (Markowitz et al., 2012), Pseudomonas Genome
Database (Winsor et al., 2009), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa et al., 2008), and Geneious 10.2.3
(Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand). Metabolic functions
encoded by the differentially expressed genes were mapped
using iPath 3.0 (Darzi et al., 2018). Phylogenetic analyses
were carried out by building multiple sequence alignments
with MAFFT v7.222 (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and inferring
neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenies with Geneious Tree Builder.
The resultant phylogenetic trees were visualized with iTOL
(Letunic and Bork, 2016). Reproducibility of clades within the
inferred NJ trees was assessed by bootstrap resampling with
1,000 replicates.
Characterization of Carbon Source
Utilization With Biolog Phenotype
Microarrays
The utilization of carbon sources was analyzed using Phenotype
MicroArrays (Biolog, Hayward, CA, United States) as follows.
The bacteria were cultured overnight on Luria-Bertani agar
at 25 C, after which cells were harvested and suspended in
inoculating fluid (IF-0). The transmittance of the suspension
was adjusted to 42% using a Biolog turbidimeter. The cell
suspension was mixed with IF􀀀0 containing Dye Mix A
(Biolog) to achieve a final transmittance of 85%. One hundred
microliter aliquots of the adjusted cell suspension were
inoculated into PM01 and PM02A plates, which were then
incubated in an OmniLog Phenotype MicroArray System
(Biolog) at 25 C for 48 h. The formation of formazan was
recorded at 15 min intervals, and data were analyzed using
OmniLog Parametric Analysis software v1.20.02 (Biolog).
Relative growth of the studied strains was normalized to
growth on D-glucose and visualized using Heatmapper
(Babicki et al., 2016).

RESULTS
Metabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates
of B. distachyon
Metabolomics analysis of lyophilized root exudates revealed
the presence of numerous plant metabolites, 86 of which were
identified by matching their spectra to the LECO/Fiehn
Metabolomics library (Supplementary Table 3). These
metabolites included (i) carbohydrates and their derivatives
(glucose, fructose, xylose, sucrose, trehalose, maltose, galactose,
and others); (ii) sugar alcohols (b-mannosylglycerate, myoinositol,
galactinol, 2-deoxyerythritol, ribitol, threitol and
cellobitol); (iii) amino acids and derivatives (glutamine,
tyrosine, glutamic acid, asparagine, aspartic acid, valine,
phenylalanine, isoleucine, glycine, serine, proline, leucine,
tryptophan, cysteine, methionine, citrulline, and others); (iv)
organic acids (aconitic, allantoic, g-aminobutyric, azelaic, citric,
fumaric, 2-furoic, D-glyceric, 3-hydroxypropionic, a-ketoadipic,
malic, methylmalonic, nicotinic, quinic, succinic, threonic);
and (v) assorted metabolites including heterocyclic compounds,
phenolics, and biogenic amines, etc (3-hydroxypyridine,
maleimide, noradrenaline, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoate,
5-methoxytryptamine, uracil, aminomalonic acid, palmitic acid,
and urea). Results of the analysis also revealed that root exudates
of B. distachyon contain hydroxyectoine and the quaternary
amine (QA) glycine betaine (Supplementary Figure 1).
Phylogenetic and Pangenome Analyses
of Pseudomonas Strains Used in the
Study
We used a set of phylogenetic markers suggested by Mulet et al.
(2010) to investigate the relatedness of the eight strains used in
this study to distinct lineages recognized within the P. fluorescens
species complex. The multilocus sequence analysis based on
the concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S
rRNA), gyrB, rpoB, and rpoD identified R1-43-08 (along with
strains 2-79 and SBW25) as a member of the P. fluorescens
subgroup (Figure 1). The rest of the strains clustered closely with
four additional subgroups of the P. fluorescens complex, namely
P. corrugata (strains Q2-87 and Q8r1-96), P. koreensis (Pf0-1),
P. protegens (Pf-5), and P. chlororaphis (30–84). The genomes of
the eight rhizosphere Pseudomonas strains varied in size by 1.43
megabase (ranging from 5.65 to 7.07 Mb) and contained between
5,166 and 6,363 protein-coding genes (Figure 2A). The shared
gene content was characterized with OrthoMCL, which uses allagainst-
all BLASTp followed by the Markov Cluster algorithm to
identify protein groups shared between the compared genomes,
as well as groups representing species-specific gene expansion
families (Li et al., 2003). The pangenome analysis revealed a
core comprised of approximately 3,179 orthologs that were
shared among all strains and represented 50.0% to 61.5%
of each predicted proteome (Figures 2A,B). The non-core
pangenome contained genes shared by two or more (but not
all) strains and contained between 1,482 and 2,080 orthologs,
which corresponded to 28.7–36.3% of individual proteomes. The
rest of the predicted protein-coding genes were strain-specific
singletons that comprised 7.5% to 15.1% of the strain’s predicted
proteomes. In respect to divergence from the core genome, strain
Pf-5 was found to possess the highest proportion of unique genes
(n = 949) followed by 2-79 (n = 887). The entire pangenome of
the Pseudomonas strains encompassed over 12,000 homolog and
singleton gene families.
Further homolog family-based comparisons identified Q8r1-
96 and R1-43-08 as the most distantly related strains, with
3349 shared homologs (Supplementary Table 4A). Q8r1-96 and
Q2-87, which shared 4,489 homologs, were the most closely
related strains. The partitioning of homolog gene families into
the core, non-core, and singleton parts of the pangenome agreed
with phylogenetic relationships of the strains deduced from the
analysis of a selected subset of COGs (Clusters of Orthologous
Groups) (Figure 2C and Supplementary Tables 4B,C). The
COG-based phylogeny supported the multilocus sequence
analysis and revealed that the eight Pseudomonas strains form
three distinct clusters, the first of which contained 2-79, R1-30-
84, and SBW25. The second cluster included Q8r1-96 and Q2-87,
whereas the third encompassed strains 30-84, Pf-5, and Pf0-1.
Correlating the Composition of Root
Exudates With Metabolic Profiles of
Pseudomonas Strains
We used the Phenotype MicroArray PM1 and PM2 plates to
profile the eight Pseudomonas strains for the utilization of
190 different carbon sources. Results of the analysis identified
90 compounds that supported growth and clustered by their
intensities of utilization into three distinct groups (Figure 3).
Group I was comprised of 30 highly metabolized carbon
sources, which included several amino acids and intermediates of
glycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, and citrate cycle. Approximately
half of these compounds were catabolized by all eight strains,
and included several organic acids (fumaric, citric, gluconic,
malic, and pyroglutamic), amino acids (Glu, Asn, Gln, Asp, Pro,
Ala, and g-aminobutyric acid), carbohydrates (glucose, mannose,
and mannitol), and the purine nucleoside inosine. Group II
was composed of 44 chemically diverse carbon sources that
were variably utilized by the strains. These compounds were
carbohydrates, organic acids, amino acids, phenolics, and polyols,
and included known compatible solutes and intermediates of
metabolism of pentoses, galactose, starch, and sucrose. Group
III encompassed the rest of the Phenotype MicroArray test
panel and contained compounds that were not catabolized
by the tested strains. Among several notable exceptions were
a-hydroxyglutamic acid- g-lactone, putrescine, and itaconic,
citramalic, and succinamic acids, which supported the growth
of strains 2-79, 30-84, Pf-5, and SBW25. We further matched
the carbon metabolic profiles of the Pseudomonas strains against
the list of plant-derived metabolites from the root exudates of

FIGURE 1 | Neighbor joining phylogeny showing the relationship of the eight strains used in this study (indicated by red triangles) to different species of the
P. fluorescens complex. The phylogeny was established based on the concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S rRNA), gyrB (subunit B of DNA
gyrase), rpoB (b subunit of RNA polymerase), and rpoD (sigma 70 factor subunit of RNA polymerase). Distance matrices were calculated by the Jukes-Cantor

B. distachyon Bd21. Interestingly, many carbon sources from
the Phenotype MicroArray panel were also present in the root
exudates of B. distachyon Bd21, and some of these compounds
(glucose, mannose, galactose, fructose, g-aminobutyric acid,
aspartic acid, citric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, quinic acid,
alanine, glutamine, and glutamic acid) were catabolized by all
strains used in this study, while others (e.g., xylose, trehalose,
m-inositol) were actively utilized only by certain organisms
(Figure 3). The comparison of catabolic profiles across the
eight studied Pseudomonas strains revealed the presence of three
distinct clusters. The first cluster contained strains Q8r1-96 and
Q2-87, which consumed very similar sets of carbon sources,
as well as strain Pf0-1. The second cluster was composed of
2-79, R1-43-08, SBW25, and 30-84, whereas the third cluster
was represented by a single strain, Pf-5. The overall similarity
of the catabolic profiles partially agreed with the separation
of the strains into different subgroups of the P. fluorescens
complex (see above).
Analysis of the RNA-seq Results
In order to understand the cellular responses of rhizosphere
Pseudomonas to plant exometabolites, we analyzed the
transcriptome changes in cultures grown in the presence of
root exudates. Under field conditions, rhizobacteria colonize
plant roots in the form of surface-attached microaerobic biofilms
(Hojberg et al., 1999). To mimic these conditions, the eight
Pseudomonas strains were grown statically at 72% air saturation
in 21C-glucose medium amended with root exudates and then
processed to extract total RNA (Supplementary Figure 2).
A total of 995 million raw sequencing reads were generated from
the RNA samples by using the Illumina HiSeq-2500 platform,
averaging 20.7 million reads per sample. The removal of lowquality
and rRNA sequences resulted in a total of 793 million
filtered reads that were mapped onto the eight Pseudomonas
genomes with a mean of 7.48 million mapped fragments per
genome. The differentially abundant transcripts were identified
by setting a p value of 0.05 (adjusted for multiple testing) and

bias due to the sequential addition of new genomes. The pangenome size increases steadily without reaching a plateau even after the addition of 11,939
non-redundant gene families. At the same time, the core genome converged to 3,179 genes. (C) The pangenome-based phylogenomic analysis of the studied
strains. Here, the pangenome was defined with OrthoMCL, and orthologous gene sets were then partitioned into the core, singleton, and non-core (the remaining
ortholog sets) categories. These categories were calculated for each node in the Maximum Likelihood species tree, using the set of genomes for which that node
represents the ancestor. The results of the ortholog partitioning are shown in pie charts placed at tree nodes. Numbers indicate bootstrap support values. The
analysis was conducted in KBase (Arkin et al., 2018).
the log2 fold-change (FC) threshold    2.0 (Figure 4 and
Supplementary Tables 5–12). When compared with the control
conditions, an average of 204 genes per strain were differentially
expressed in the presence of root exudates, with the highest
(n = 425) and lowest (n = 112) numbers observed, respectively,
in SBW25 and Q2-87 (Figure 4). Overall, more genes were
induced than repressed in response to exudates, but the actual
numbers in each category varied substantially depending on the
identity of the Pseudomonas strain. In most strains, the bulk of
the differentially expressed genes was almost equally distributed
between the core (mean, 48.2%) and non-core (mean, 45.8%)
parts of the genome, whereas the strain-specific singleton genes
constituted on average only 5.9% (Figure 4B). One notable
exception was observed in Q8r1-96, where all differentially
expressed genes belonged to the core (73.8%) and non-core
(26.2%) parts of the genome. Another notable pattern was
observed in R1-43-08, where the majority of genes affected by
the presence of root exudate fell into the non-core category
(56.3%). The highest proportion of differentially expressed
singletons (11.3 and 10.4%, respectively) was identified in
strains SBW25 and Pf-5.
We further explored how the identified differentially
expressed genes were distributed across genomes of the eight
studied rhizosphere strains. The pairwise BLASTp comparisons
identified 2-79 and SBW25 as two strains that shared the highest
number of genes (n = 101) induced or repressed in response
to root exudates (Table 1). The second pair of strains with
a significant number of similar differentially expressed genes
(n = 86) was Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, which was followed by Pf0-1
and 30-84, which shared 56 differentially expressed genes. These
patterns of shared genes were also observed when the results of
the pairwise BLASTp comparisons were converted into a binary
gene presence/absence matrix, which was then subjected to
cluster analysis using a UPGMA algorithm based on Sorensen’s
dissimilarity index or examined by non-metric multidimensional
scaling (NMDS) (Figure 5).
The differentially expressed Pseudomonas genes were
subjected to Blast2Go analysis and Gene Ontology (GO)
annotation (Figure 6). Metabolic process, catalytic activity,
and membrane were the most common annotation terms
across the three primary GO term categories (i.e., biological
process, molecular function, and cellular component). A total
of 1,694 GO terms was assigned to 805 upregulated genes, with
the majority of the GO terms related to molecular function
(682, 40.3%), followed by biological process (669, 39.5%), and
cellular component (343, 20.2%). In the 539 downregulated gene
category, 1,101 GO terms were assigned to biological process
(420, 38.1%), molecular function (417, 37.9%), and cellular
component (264, 24.0%). Within biological process, metabolic
process, cellular process, localization, response to stimulus, and
regulation were over-represented. Within molecular function,
the largest proportion was assigned to catalytic activity, binding,
and transporter activity categories. Within cellular component,
the majority were assigned to membrane, membrane part, cell,
and cell part categories. Across the eight strains, 37–42% of
differentially expressed genes had no Gene Ontology IDs and
encoded various conserved hypothetical proteins.
Functional Classification of Shared
Differentially Expressed Genes
The interrogation of RNA-seq data revealed multiple cellular
pathways that were differentially regulated in bacterial cultures
incubated with root exudates (Supplementary Figures 3, 4).

FIGURE 3 | Biolog Phenotype MicroArray profiling the eight rhizosphere
Pseudomonas strains used in the study. The hierarchical clustering analysis
was carried out using the average linkage method with Euclidean distances.
Carbon sources identified by red arrowheads were also detected in the sterile
root exudates of B. distachyon Bd21.
Although none of these differentially regulated pathways were
shared by all eight strains, the cross-strain comparisons revealed
several types of common and specific transcriptomic responses
that were elicited by the presence of plant exometabolites
(Table 2). The visual representation of core gene expression
patterns is provided in Supplementary Figure 5, which
shows heatmaps of expression profiles and p-adj values for
core genes shared by the studied strains. The figure is
accompanied by Supplementary Table 13 that lists predicted
functions of genes constituting the four distinct clusters
observed after hierarchical clustering of gene expression
values. The first category of shared differentially expressed
pathways functioned in the uptake and catabolism of selected
carbohydrates, quaternary ammonium compounds (QAs), and
phenolics. All strains except for R1-43-08, responded to root
exudates by inducing the fructose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate
(PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTSFru). The
components of this system are encoded by a conserved
operon and include the cytoplasmic polyprotein EI/HPr/EIIAFru
(FruB), the 1-phosphofructokinase FruK, and the fructosespecific
permease EIIBC (FruA) (Chavarria et al., 2016). The
PTSFru system functions by acquiring high-energy phosphates
from PEP and sequentially passing them, via the EI/HPr/EIIAFru
domains of FruB, to the EIIB component of FruA. The
phosphates are ultimately transferred by the EIIC transporter
to fructose yielding fructose 1-phosphate, which is channeled
into the central metabolic pathways through the action of the
phosphofructokinase FruK.
In all strains except for Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, the exposure to root
exudates resulted in the induction of two genes adjacent to the
fru cluster that encoded a Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS)
transporter and an L-arabinonate dehydratase (Table 2). These
genes are predicted to participate in the uptake and catabolism
of L-arabinose, where L-arabinonate dehydratase plays an
important role by converting L-arabinonate to 2-dehydro-3-
deoxy-L-arabinonate (Rahman et al., 2017). In SBW25, R1-
43-08, and Q2-87, we also observed the induction of genes
encoding components of the AraFGH complex, an ATP-Binding
Cassette (ABC) superfamily transporter involved in the import of
arabinose into the cell (Supplementary Tables 6, 7, 9). Finally, all
strains except SBW25 and R1-43-08 responded to the presence
of exudates by upregulating a conserved gene encoding an
aldose epimerase superfamily protein. Such enzymes equilibrate
alpha- and beta-anomers of aldoses and ensure that stereospecific
enzymes involved in the metabolism of free sugars do not act as
metabolic bottlenecks (Abayakoon et al., 2018). Although some
aldose epimerases have been linked to specific pathways, the
Pseudomonas gene identified in this study could not be assigned
to a particular metabolic process based on sequence analysis and
genomic location.
Several Pseudomonas strains responded to the presence
of root exudates by upregulating genes involved in the
uptake and catabolism of myo-inositol and possibly other
stereoisomers of inositol (Table 2). The upregulated catabolic
genes encode the dehydrogenase IolG, which oxidizes myoinositol
to its corresponding ketone, as well as IolE, IolD, IolB,
and IolC that collectively convert the 2-keto-myo-inositol to
acetyl-CoA and the glycolysis intermediate dihydroxyacetone
phosphate (Yoshida et al., 2008; Kohler et al., 2011). In R1-
43-08, Q8r1-96, Q2-87, and Pf-5, the upregulated functions

threshold. (B) Circular diagrams depicting the distribution of differentially expressed genes among the core, non-core, and singleton proteomes of individual

also involved components of the putative inositol-specific
ABC transporter. The cross-genome comparisons revealed
that in all studied strains except for Pf0-1, components
of the myo-inositol utilization pathway were encoded
within a well-conserved gene cluster which, in addition to
catabolic and transport functions, also encodes a dedicated
transcriptional repressor.
All studied strains of Pseudomonas carry multiple genes
involved in scavenging the quaternary ammonium compounds
choline, glycine betaine (GB), carnitine, choline-O-sulfate, and

sarcosine from the environment. Many of these genes were
differentially expressed, including those encoding parts of the
ABC transporter CbcXWV, which is predicted to function in
the uptake of choline under water-replete conditions (Table 2).
Among enzymes induced in the presence of root exudates were
the choline dehydrogenase BetA, which converts choline to
glycine betaine and a network of enzymes (i.e., the Rieske family
oxygenase GbcAB, the dimethyglycine demethylase DgcAB, and
the sarcosine oxidase SoxBDAG) that sequentially convert GB
to glycine. In 2-79 and SBW25, this group of differentially
regulated genes also included an AraC-family transcriptional
activator GbdR, which perceives intercellular levels of GB and
induces genes involved in the transport and catabolism of
glycine betaine and detoxification of the catabolic byproducts
(Hampel et al., 2014).
The last category of activated catabolic pathways included the
catechol branch of the b-ketoadipate pathway for the degradation
of aromatic compounds. In strains 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5,
growth on root exudates resulted in upregulation of catechol-
1,2-dioxygenase, muconate cycloisomerase, and muconolactone
isomerase, which collectively cleave the catechol ring and
convert it to b-ketoadipate enol-lactone (Harwood and Parales,
1996). Finally, analysis of the P. synxantha 2-79 transcriptome
identified an induction of benABC genes encoding subunits
of benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase, an oxidoreductase that generates
catechol from benzoate.
In addition to various catabolic pathways, the exposure to root
exudates also induced several genes involved in the homeostasis
of copper (Table 2). Four of these genes form a conserved cluster
in genomes of the strains and encode the periplasmic coppersensing
two-component system CinRS, the plastocyanin/azurinlike
protein CinA, and the NADPH-dependent pre-Q0 reductase
CinQ. Also, in strains Q2-87, 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, we observed
upregulation of a conserved operon encoding the multicopper
oxidase CopA, the periplasmic copper-binding protein CopC, the
inner membrane protein CopD, and outer membrane protein
CopB. In several Gram-negative bacteria, these Cop proteins are
thought to have dual functions and participate both in the uptake
of essential copper as well as in the sequestration of excess copper
in the periplasm and outer membrane.
The analysis of shared downregulated pathways revealed that
most of the strains respond to the presence of root exudates by
repressing genes involved in the uptake and catabolism of sulfur
compounds (Table 2). In strains SBW25, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96,
Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, this response involved the ssuEADCB
operon responsible for the utilization of alkanesulfonates
as sulfur sources. The ssu operon is highly conserved in
fluorescent pseudomonads and encodes the FMNH2-dependent
monooxygenase SsuD and the NAD (P)H-dependent FMN
reductase SsuE, which together catalyze the desulfonation of
alkanesulfonates. Also, the ssu locus contains genes for the
molybdopterin-binding protein SsuF and the alkanesulfonatespecific
ABC-type transporter consisting of the sulfonate
substrate-binding protein SsuA, sulfonate permease protein
SsuC, and sulfonate transport ATP-binding protein SsuB. Finally,
in R1-43-08, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, growth on root exudates
coincided with repression of the tauABCD operon, which
allows these strains to utilize taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonate)
as a sulfur source. The repressed tau genes encoded the
2-oxoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenase TauD and
substrate-binding, ATP-binding, and permease components of
the taurine-specific ABC transporter TauABC.
Other Differentially Expressed Pathways
In addition to their effect on several shared cellular pathways,
growth on root exudates resulted in the induction or repression of
numerous strain-specific genes. In closely related P. synxantha 2-
79 and P. fluorescens SBW25, we observed differential expression
of genes involved in energy metabolism, transport of amino
acids, and surface attachment (Supplementary Tables 5, 6).
Other notable differentially expressed pathways included 2–
79 gene clusters that encode enzymes for the catabolism of
trehalose, a prophage, and toxin/antitoxin system, as well as the
SBW25 operon predicted to control the synthesis of the capsular
exopolysaccharide colonic acid. The response of Pseudomonas sp.
R1-43-08 to root exudates also involved differential expression
of different energy metabolism pathways. In addition, we
observed the upregulation of genes involved in the uptake and
catabolism of xylose (also upregulated in 2–79) and repression
of enzymes for the biosynthesis of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid
and assimilation of inorganic sulfur and L-cysteine biosynthesis
(Supplementary Table 7).
The analysis of the Q8r1-96 transcriptome revealed
perturbation of different metabolic pathways including genes
encoding components of cytochrome C oxidase, transport
and catabolism of sorbitol/mannitol, metabolism of butanoic
acid, and biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides alginate and
poly-b-1-6-N-acetylglucosamine (Supplementary Table 8). In
P. fluorescens Q2-87, we identified differential expression of
genes involved in metabolism of galactose, tryptophan, tyrosine,
glycine, serine, and threonine (Supplementary Table 9),
while in P. chlororaphis 30-84, growth on exudates activated
the biosynthesis of molybdopterin cofactor, catabolism of
galactonate and acetoin, and uptake and catabolism of putrescine
(Supplementary Table 10). The response of P. protegens Pf-5 to
root exudates involved upregulation of acetoin dehydrogenase,
which converts acetoin to acetaldehyde and acetyl-CoA, as

and Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al., 2018). On a WEGO histogram, the percentage of 100 is defined as the total number of genes assigned a GO
term. However, the subcategories do not add up to 100% because many genes fall into more than one functional class and are therefore annotated by multiple GO
terms.
well as pathways for the utilization of glycolate and putrescine
(Supplementary Table 11). Also induced were genes for
the production of pyrrolnitrin and PhlG hydrolase, which
modulate the metabolic loads attributed to the synthesis of
2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol. The differentially expressed genes of
P. fluorescens Pf0-1 included, among others, operons encoding
cytochrome C oxidase and enzymes for catabolism of malonic
acid (Supplementary Table 12). Yet another interesting
finding involved the induction of assorted genes acting in the
homeostasis of iron and defense against reactive oxygen species
(ROS). We observed activation of iron dicitrate transporters
(SBW25 and 30-84), genes for the biosynthesis of siderophores
ornicorrugatin (SBW25) and pyochelin (Pf-5), heme-degrading
enzymes (2–79, 30–84), TonB siderophore receptors, and
components of the energy-transducing inner membrane
complex TonB-ExbB-ExbD (2–79 and Pf-5). The differentially
expressed ROS defense pathways were represented by different
catalases in strains 2–79, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and
Pf-5 and organic hydroperoxide resistance proteins in strains
SBW25 and R1-43-08. Finally, in SBW25, Q2-87, 30–84, and
Pf0-1, the addition of exudates resulted in the upregulation of
peroxiredoxins that detoxify H2O2, peroxynitrite, and aliphatic
and aromatic hydroperoxides.
DISCUSSION

mix of primary and secondary metabolites, thus supporting

Mavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome
soil microorganisms. Our results were in agreement with a
recent report of 27 different sugars, amino acids, and organic
acids in Brachypodium exudates (Kawasaki et al., 2016). We
confirmed the presence of exometabolites identified in that
study, along with dozens of additional analytes that were
identified by matching their mass-spectra and retention indices
to the LECO/Fiehn Metabolomics library (Supplementary
Table 3). The complementation of the metabolomic analysis
with profiling of the bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays
revealed that a substantial proportion of the characterized
exudate constituents were catabolized by a collection of eight
Pseudomonas strains from across the P. fluorescens group that is
known to form associations with plant roots. The amendment
of Pseudomonas cultures with root exudates caused changes in
the expression of multiple genes encoding catabolic and anabolic
enzymes, predicted transporters, transcriptional regulators, stress
response, and conserved hypothetical proteins. In most strains,
these differentially expressed genes were almost equally split
between the core and variable genome regions, mirroring
the substantial strain-to-strain variation in the genome size
and gene content within the P. fluorescens species complex
(Loper et al., 2012).
The analysis of transcriptome responses to root exudates
revealed several types of cellular pathways present in the strains
used in this study. The first category of such pathways was
involved in the catabolism of carbohydrates such as fructose,
arabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, trehalose, and galactose. Among
these catabolic traits, the ability to utilize fructose as a carbon
source is highly conserved among fluorescent pseudomonads.
In contrast, growth on arabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, and
trehalose is variably present and was traditionally used to
differentiate species and biovars within the P. fluorescens
group (Barrett et al., 1986). We speculate that such variably
distributed pathways contribute to the differential affinity of
pseudomonads toward host plants and/or to determine which
strains flourish in response to growing roots and changing
environments. Several independent studies have confirmed
the importance of carbohydrate catabolism pathways for the
biology of rhizosphere pseudomonads. For example, in vivo
expression technology (IVET) profiling of P. fluorescens SBW25
identified xylose isomerase among genome regions essential
for the colonization of sugar beet seedlings (Liu et al., 2015),
whereas a genome-wide Tn-Seq screen of Pseudomonas simiae
identified genes for the catabolism of myo-inositol among traits
essential for the colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana roots
(Cole et al., 2017).
The response of rhizosphere Pseudomonas to Brachypodium
root exudates also involved pathways for the uptake and
metabolism of amino acids. We observed differential
expression of genes encoding the hydrophobic (HAAT) and
polar (PAAT) amino acid uptake transporters in strains
2-79, SBW25, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5. Other related genes
encoded enzymes for the catabolism of valine and glutamic
acid (2-79); metabolism of tryptophan, glycine, serine, and
threonine (Q2-87); and biosynthesis of methionine (Q8r1-
96). It is plausible that the abundance of amino acids in
root exudates is also linked to the repression of pathways
involved in the catabolism of sulfonates and taurine that
was observed in several strains (Table 2). Although the
preferred source of sulfur for P. fluorescens is unknown, in the
closely related P. aeruginosa, the sulfur starvation response
is triggered by the growth on any sulfur compound other
than sulfate, thiocyanate, and cysteine (Hummerjohann et al.,
1998). This fact, together with the presence of cysteine and
cystine in the root exudates, suggest that root exudates of
Brachypodium may serve as an important source of sulfur for
rhizosphere Pseudomonas. These findings also agree well with
the reported scarcity of inorganic sulfate in the soil, and the
presence of sulfur mostly in the form of organic compounds,
including amino acids, proteins, sulfate esters, and sulfonates
(Autry and Fitzgerald, 1990).
Another interesting result of this study was the concerted
activation of copper and iron homeostasis pathways observed
in all of the Pseudomonas strains used in this work. In bacteria,
an excess of copper is toxic and triggers oxidative stress due to
the formation of free radicals, as well as disruption of protein
metalation and stability of iron-sulfur clusters (Bondarczuk
and Piotrowska-Seget, 2013). On the other hand, copper is an
essential trace element used as a cofactor in different enzymes.
Similarly, although elevated levels of iron cause redox stress, this
element is also found in active energy metabolism enzymes and is
crucial for bacterial growth (Andrews et al., 2003). The analysis
of metal homeostasis genes identified in this study suggests
that their induction was likely triggered by the deficiency of
copper and iron in bacterial cultures grown in the presence of
root exudates. We attribute this effect to the ability of some
components of root exudates to chelate soil metals.
Despite the abundance of iron in the soil, its bioavailability
is limited due to the low solubility of Fe (III) oxyhydrates
at neutral pH. The non-graminaceous plants circumvent this
problem by acidifying the rhizosphere and secreting flavins,
phenolics, and organic acids that chelate iron. The reduction
of these ferric chelates releases soluble ferrous iron taken up
by root cells (Kobayashi and Nishizawa, 2012). Graminaceous
plants, like Brachypodium, acquire iron by secreting into the
soil non-protein amino acids of the mugineic acid (MA) group,
which act as Fe (III)-chelating phytosiderophores. In addition to
iron, low-molecular-weight organic acids and phytosiderophores
bind other divalent and trivalent metals (including copper) and
contribute to heavy-metal tolerance in plants (Chen et al., 2017).
It is plausible that the presence of these plant exometabolites
is responsible for the deficit of iron and copper observed in
Pseudomonas cultures grown in the presence of root exudates.
These results further underscore the importance of diverse and
redundant metal homeostasis pathways found in genomes of the
P. fluorescens group for the ability of these organisms to colonize
and persist in the plant rhizosphere.
Recently, Klonowska et al. (2018) examined transcriptomic
responses of symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria to root
exudates of the legume plant Mimosa pundica, which has
an unusual ability to support both alpha- (Rhizobium) and
beta-rhizobia (Cupriavidus and Burkholderia). Using RNA-seq,
the authors characterized genes involved in the perception of
root exudates in the nodulating bacteria Burkholderia phymatum
Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 14 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282
Mavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome
STM815, Cupriavidus taiwanensis LMG19424, and Rhizobium
mesoamericanum STM3625. Interestingly, the analysis of
differentially expressed genes revealed induction of pathways
involved in the catabolism of fructose, xylose, myo-inositol,
and protocatechuate/catechol. Also upregulated were some
copper homeostasis, siderophore biosynthesis, and oxidative
stress genes. Finally, the analytical profiling of M. pundica
exudates revealed an overlap with Brachypodium in the types of
carbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids present. These
findings suggest that differentially expressed genes shared by
multiple strains of the group P. fluorescens are not unique to
the Brachypodium-Pseudomonas system but represent a set
of conserved cellular pathways involved in the perception of
plant exometabolites by different clades of rhizosphere-dwelling
Proteobacteria.
Most strains included in this study were originally selected
based on the ability to colonize the rhizosphere and produce
secondary metabolites that alleviate the plant stress response
and/or inhibit soilborne pathogens. It has been suggested
that plant metabolites released into the rhizosphere affect
the biocontrol activity of plant-beneficial pseudomonads (de
Werra et al., 2011). We provide further support to this
hypothesis by demonstrating that in some strains, root exudates
modulate the expression of genes for the catabolism of
the plant growth-promoting metabolites acetoin and 2,3-
butanediol. The exposure to exudates also affected the expression
of genes for the synthesis of well-characterized antifungal
compounds pyrrolnitrin, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, and 2,4-
diacetylphloroglucinol. The modulatory effects were strainspecific,
suggesting significant differences in the regulatory
networks involved in the perception of plant signals and
regulation of the production of antibiotics and growthpromoting
metabolites.
The final significant finding of this study was the induction
of catabolism of quaternary amines (QAs) observed in multiple
strains of the P. fluorescens group during growth on root
exudates. This observation was supported by the detection of
glycine betaine in the root secretions of B. distachyon. The
presence of QAs in plant tissues and the capacity of these
metabolites to provide stress protection and nutrients to plant
pathogens and symbionts were reported before (Boncompagni
et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2013; Kabbadj et al., 2017), but our
study is among the first to highlight the potential importance of
these metabolites for rhizosphere interactions. Pseudomonads do
not synthesize QAs de novo but have evolved many pathways to
scavenge them from eukaryotic hosts, where these metabolites
are abundant due to the prominence of phosphatidylcholine
in cellular membranes. Strains of P. fluorescens carry genes
for the conversion of choline, carnitine, and glycine betaine to
glycine, as well as quaternary amine transporters of the BCCT
and ABC families that are also conserved in the opportunistic
human pathogen P. aeruginosa and the plant pathogen P. syringae
(Galvao et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2013; Wargo, 2013b).
In P. aeruginosa, choline catabolism genes are essential for
the ability of this pathogen to persist during lung infection
(Wargo, 2013a). Similarly, a P. syringae mutant deficient in
BetT, OpuC, and CbcXWV quaternary amine transporters had
reduced fitness during colonization of bean and soybean leaves
under greenhouse and field conditions (Chen et al., 2013).
Depending on water availability, P. aeruginosa and P. syringae
catabolize exogenously supplied QAs as carbon and nitrogen
sources or accumulate them as osmoprotectants (Chen et al.,
2013; Wargo, 2013b). Our ongoing work in P. synxantha 2–
79 unraveled similar physiological responses and demonstrated
that QA transporters function differentially and redundantly
in the uptake of quaternary amines as nutrients (Pablo and
Mavrodi, unpublished). In contrast, under water stress, the QAs
choline, betaine, and carnitine are accumulated preferentially for
osmoprotection. Under drought stress, a 2–79 mutant devoid
of all known QA transporters was less competitive in the
colonization of the Brachypodium rhizosphere than its wild-type
parental strain. Interestingly, our metabolomic profiling of root
exudates also revealed proline, glutamine, and hydroxyectoine.
These metabolites act as compatible solutes in different groups
of microorganisms (Yancey et al., 1982; Empadinhas and da
Costa, 2008), suggesting an important role of root exudates
in the ability of Pseudomonas to persist in the rhizosphere of
drought-stressed plants.

Plant roots secrete carbon-rich rhizodeposits containing primary and\nsecondary low molecular weight metabolites, lysates, and mucilages. These exudates\nprovide nutrients for soil microorganisms and modulate their affinity to host plants, but\nmolecular details of this process are largely unresolved. We addressed this gap by\nfocusing on the molecular dialog between eight well-characterized beneficial strains\nof the Pseudomonas fluorescens group and Brachypodium distachyon, a model for\neconomically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops of the grass family. We\ncollected and analyzed root exudates of B. distachyon and demonstrated the presence\nof multiple carbohydrates, amino acids, organic acids, and phenolic compounds. The\nsubsequent screening of bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays revealed that many\nof these metabolites provide carbon and energy for the Pseudomonas strains. RNAseq\nprofiling of bacterial cultures amended with root exudates revealed changes in the\nexpression of genes encoding numerous catabolic and anabolic enzymes, transporters,\ntranscriptional regulators, stress response, and conserved hypothetical proteins. Almost\nhalf of the differentially expressed genes mapped to the variable part of the strains’\npangenome, reflecting the importance of the variable gene content in the adaptation of\nP. fluorescens to the rhizosphere lifestyle. Our results collectively reveal the diversity\nof cellular pathways and physiological responses underlying the establishment of\nmutualistic interactions between these beneficial rhizobacteria and their plant hosts.\nKeywords: Pseudomonas, Brachypodium, rhizosphere, root exudates, transcriptome\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 1 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nINTRODUCTION\nPlants are meta-organisms or holobionts that rely in part on\ntheir microbiome for specific functions and traits. The ability\nof the plant microbiome to influence plant development, vigor,\nhealth, and fitness in response to abiotic stressors associated\nwith global climate change is documented by numerous studies\n(Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009). There is mounting evidence\nthat plants actively recruit beneficial microbiomes, but many\naspects of this process are still very much a black box (Reinhold-\nHurek et al., 2015). The foundation for the differential affinity\nof rhizobacteria toward host plants is built upon complex\nchemical cross talk between microorganisms and plant roots.\nUp to 40% of photosynthetically fixed carbon is released by\nplant roots in the form of exudates and secretions, lysates, and\nmucilages (Curl and Truelove, 1986; Lynch, 1990; Whipps, 1990;\nBadri and Vivanco, 2009). The release of these compounds is\nactively controlled in response to environmental stimuli, and the\ncomposition of root exudates varies greatly according to plant\nspecies and physiological condition (Lynch, 1990; Nguyen, 2003;\nPhillips et al., 2004; De-la-Pena et al., 2008). The presence and\ncomposition of exudates strongly impact soil microorganisms,\nwhich is consistent with the idea that plants actively select and\nshape their root microbiota (Zolla et al., 2013).\nPrimary root exudates include simple and complex sugars,\namino acids, polypeptides and proteins, organic, aliphatic and\nfatty acids, sterols, and phenolics (Nguyen, 2003; Badri and\nVivanco, 2009; Badri et al., 2009). These compounds serve as\ncarbon and energy sources for rhizobacteria, and the presence\nof the intact corresponding catabolic pathways is essential\nfor competitive colonization of roots and disease suppression\n(Lugtenberg et al., 2001; Kamilova et al., 2005; Lugtenberg and\nKamilova, 2009). Root exudates also contain numerous signal\nmolecules and secondary metabolites, the significance of which\nis only now emerging (Walker et al., 2003; Bais et al., 2005,\n2006). A handful of analyses of plant-induced gene expression\nby transcriptional profiling in vitro (Mark et al., 2005) or in\nthe rhizosphere (Silby and Levy, 2004; Ramos-Gonzalez et al.,\n2005; Matilla et al., 2007; Barret et al., 2009) have identified\nmultiple genes that are differentially regulated by exposure to\nroots or root exudates. Bacterial pathways expressed during\nrhizosphere colonization control utilization of plant-derived\nmetabolites (Simons et al., 1996, 1997; Camacho-Carvajal, 2001;\nLugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), motility and chemotaxis (de\nWeert et al., 2002; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), phase\nvariation (Dekkers et al., 1998; Sanchez-Contreras et al., 2002;\nvan den Broek et al., 2005), outer membrane integrity (de Weert\net al., 2006; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), and the ability\nto sequester limiting resources (Raaijmakers et al., 1995) and\nresist environmental stresses (Sarniguet et al., 1995; Miller and\nWood, 1996; van Veen et al., 1997; Schnider-Keel et al., 2001). In\nits spatial and temporal properties, root colonization resembles\nbiofilm formation, and biofilm-related pathways also have been\nimplicated in adhesion to seeds and roots and rhizosphere\ncolonization (Espinosa-Urgel et al., 2000; Hinsa et al., 2003;\nYousef-Coronado et al., 2008; Fuqua, 2010; Martinez-Gil et al.,\n2010; Nielsen et al., 2011; Zboralski and Filion, 2020). Finally,\nroot exudates strongly affect the expression of diverse plant\ngrowth promotion and biocontrol genes (Vacheron et al., 2013).\nOver the past decade, the genomes of numerous rhizosphere\nstrains have been sequenced and analyzed, but functional\ngenomics studies of rhizosphere competence lag behind the\navailability of sequence data.\nThis study explored the molecular dialog between the\nmodel host plant Brachypodium distachyon and several wellcharacterized\nrhizosphere strains of the Pseudomonas fluorescens\ngroup. Brachypodium is a small annual grass originating in semiarid\nregions of the Middle East that has emerged as a prime model\nfor economically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops\nof the grass family (Bevan et al., 2010; Schwartz et al., 2010;\nBrkljacic et al., 2011; Hong et al., 2011; Tyler et al., 2014). The\nbiology, extensive collection of resources, and research tools\nmake B. distachyon an attractive model to investigate interactions\nbetween plants and root-associated microbes. Pseudomonads\nare ubiquitous Gram-negative g-proteobacteria that colonize\neukaryotic hosts and include both commensals and economically\nimportant pathogens of plants and animals (Moore et al.,\n2006; Schroth et al., 2006; Yahr and Parsek, 2006). The genus\nPseudomonas currently comprises > 100 named species that have\nbeen separated based on multilocus sequence analysis into 14\nspecies groups (Garrido-Sanz et al., 2016; Hesse et al., 2018).\nThe P. fluorescens group is the most diverse regarding both\nthe genetic distances within it, the number of species and the\nlarge pangenome that makes up > 50% of the pangenome\nof the genus as a whole (Loper et al., 2012). The group also\nencompasses an unusually high proportion of strains that inhabit\nthe plant rhizosphere and possess plant growth promoting and\nbiocontrol properties. Naylor et al. (2017) profiled bacterial\ncommunities associated with root tissues and rhizosphere of\n18 different plant species of the Poaceae family. That study\nidentified Pseudomonas among taxa constituting the core grass\nroot microbiome and demonstrated that these bacteria were\nenriched in C3 plants, including wheat, rye, barley, oat, and\nBrachypodium. We confirmed the capacity of B. distachyon\nBd21 to serve as a host for rhizobacteria of the P. fluorescens\ngroup in preliminary greenhouse assays with biocontrol strains\nP. synxantha 2-79, P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96, and P. protegens\nPf-5. Results of these experiments revealed that all strains\nsuccessfully established and colonized the roots of Brachypodium\n(Supplementary Table 1).\nIn this study, we focused on eight well-studied strains\nof the P. fluorescens complex that are supported by years\nof studies, numerous refereed publications, and high-quality\ngenome sequences. By profiling transcriptomes of these strains\nduring growth in root exudates of B. distachyon, we revealed the\ndiversity of cellular pathways and physiological responses that\nunderlie the establishment of mutualistic interactions between\nbeneficial rhizobacteria and the host plant. Our results also\nconfirmed that root exudates contain carbohydrates, amino acids,\norganic acids, and phenolics that serve as carbon and energy\nsources for rhizobacteria. The root exudates also contained\nosmoprotectants that may help microorganisms to persist in the\nrhizosphere of drought-stressed plants.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nthe variable genome in adaptation of individual strains of\nPseudomonas to the rhizosphere lifestyle.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacterial Strains Used in the Study\nThe eight Pseudomonas strains used for this study are\nP. synxantha 2-79 (Thomashow and Weller, 1988), P. fluorescens\nSBW25 (Silby et al., 2009), Pseudomonas sp. R1-43-08 (Parejko\net al., 2012), P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96 (Raaijmakers and Weller,\n1998), P. fluorescens Q2-87 (Bangera and Thomashow, 1996),\nP. chlororaphis 30-84 (Thomashow et al., 1990), P. fluorescens\nPf0-1 (Silby et al., 2009), and P. protegens Pf-5 (Howell and\nStipanovic, 1980). The selected organisms have been studied\nextensively for their role in biological control and plant\ngrowth promotion (Supplementary Table 2). The strains were\nmaintained in the laboratory as frozen stocks (\U0010000080\u2000C) and\nroutinely cultured in King’s medium B (King et al., 1954) or\n21C medium, which contained (per 1 L): 1.0 g of NH4Cl, 3.5 g\nof Na2HPO4\u20002H2O, 2.8 g of KH2PO4, 3.0 g of glucose, and\n20 ml of a microelement solution (Smibert and Kreig, 1994;\nHalverson and Firestone, 2000).\nPropagation of Plants and Collection of\nRoot Exudates\nB. distachyon Bd21 was established from seed material obtained\nfrom the USDA-ARS Plant Germplasm Introduction and Testing\nResearch Unit (Pullman, WA, United States). Brachypodium\nseeds were imbibed for 3 days at 4\u2000C and sown in 7 \u2000 7 cm\npots filled with Sunshine Potting Mix #4 (Sun Gro Horticulture,\nAgawam, MA, United States). Plants were grown in an IR-\n89X (Percival Scientific, Perry, IA, United States) controlled\nenvironment chamber retrofitted with 6500K and 3000K T5 54W\ngrow lights (Spectralux) under a 20-h light, 24\u2000C/4-h dark, 18\u2000C\ncycle. Plants were watered and fertilized with Jack’s professional\nwater-soluble fertilizer (20:20:20) (JR Peters, Allentown, PA,\nUnited States). After 12 weeks and plant senescence, seeds\nwere collected, processed, and stored under desiccant and dark\nconditions at room temperature.\nTo collect root exudates, seeds of B. distachyon Bd21 were\nsurface-sterilized, pregerminated, and placed in sterile 1 L widemouth\nglass jars containing 113 g of 6-mm glass beads and\n25 ml distilled water. Jars were covered with vented caps\nand plants were grown hydroponically in an environmental\ncontrolled growth chamber under conditions described above.\nAfter 6 days, root exudates were extracted from individual\njars and their sterility was confirmed by spotting on nutrient\nagar. Multiple batches of root exudates were collected, filtered\n(0.22 mm), aliquoted in Falcon tubes (10 ml), lyophilized, and\nstored at –80\u2000C.\nMetabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates\nExudates were analyzed for primary metabolites at the Murdock\nMetabolomics Laboratory at Washington State University\n(Pullman, WA, United States). Freeze-dried residues were\nsuspended in 500 ml 50% aqueous acetonitrile and clarified by\ncentrifugation for 20 min at 21,000 \u2000 g and 4\u2000C. The liquid\nchromatography mass spectrometry analysis was conducted\nwith a Synapt G2-S quadrupole-ion mobility spectrometrytime\nof flight mass spectrometer system equipped with an\nacquity ultra-performance liquid chromatograph (UPLC) and\nan acquity photodiode array detector (all from Waters, Milford,\nMA, United States). The exudate metabolites were separated\non a SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC HPLC column (2.1 \u2000 100 mm,\n3 mm) (Milllipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, United States) using\nacetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid as solvent B and water\nwith 0.1% formic acid as solvent A at a flow rate of 400 ml\nmin\U001000001 and the following linear gradient extending over 14 min:\n0 min, 80% B; 4 min, 80% B, 6 min: 10% B; 7.5 min, 10%\nB; 10 min, 80% B; and 14 min, 80% B. Mass spectra were\ncollected in positive ion mode over a range of m/z 50–1,200\nwith a scan time of 0.2 s. The Q-TOF-MS source was at\n3.0 kV and 120\u2000C; the sampling cone at 40 V, desolvation\ntemperature was 250\u2000C; cone gas and desolvation gas flow were\nat 0 and 850 L h\U001000001, respectively. Leucine enkephalin was used\nfor post-acquisition mass correction. Target compounds were\nvisualized using selected ion chromatograms at 0.05 Da window\nwidth. The compound identification was based on comparison\nof chromatographic behavior and accurate masses to those of\nauthentic standards.\nFor gas chromatography, derivatization was carried out using\na modification of the procedure of Lee and Fiehn (2008).\nThe freeze-dried residues were suspended in 950 ml aqueous\nmethanol (84%, v/v) and clarified by centrifugation for 15 min\nat 21,000 \u2000 g at 4\u2000C. The supernatants were spiked with 1\nmg of the internal standard salicylic acid-d6 (C/D/N Isotopes,\nQuebec, Canada) and dried in vacuo. The dry residues were\nsuspended in 10 ml of O-methoxylamine hydrochloride (30 mg\nml\U001000001 in anhydrous pyridine, both from Millipore Sigma) and\nincubated while mixing (1,000 RPM) for 90 min at 30\u2000C.\nSubsequently, samples were derivatized with 90 ml of MSTFA\nwith 1% TMCS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,\nUnited States) for 30 min at 37\u2000C. Gas chromatography-mass\nspectroscopy analysis was performed using a Pegasus 4D timeof-\nflight mass spectrometer (LECO, Saint Joseph MI) equipped\nwith a MPS2 autosampler (Gerstel, Linthicum, MD) and a 7890A\noven (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States).\nThe derivatization products were separated on a 30-m, 0.25 mm\ni.d., 0.25 mm df Rxi-5Sil column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA,\nUnited States) with an IntegraGuard precolumn using ultrapure\nHe at a constant flow of 0.9 ml min\U001000001 as carrier gas. The linear\nthermal gradient started with a 1-min hold at 70\u2000C, followed\nby a ramp to 300\u2000C at 10\u2000C min\U001000001. The final temperature was\nheld for 5 min prior to returning to initial conditions. Mass\nspectra were collected at 17 spectra s\U001000001. Peak identification was\nconducted using the Fiehn primary metabolite library (Kind\net al., 2009) and an identity score cutoff of 700.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nIsolation of RNA From Bacteria Cultured\nin Root Exudates and RNA-Seq\nThe strains were pregrown overnight at 25\u2000C on 21C-glucose\nagar and then subcultured into 96-well microplates containing\nliquid 21C-glucose medium amended with Brachypodium\nexudates. The liquid medium was prepared by dissolving the\nlyophilized root exudate material in an appropriate volume of\n21C-glucose medium to concentrate root exudates 20-fold. The\ngrowth medium was sterilized by passing it through a 0.22-\nmm membrane filter. The control cultures were grown under\nidentical conditions in the absence of exudates. All treatments\nwere inoculated at OD600 of 0.1 and incubated for 20 to\n22 h until cultures entered late-exponential growth phase at\n25\u2000C in an atmosphere of 15% oxygen [created by a ProOx\nP110 oxygen controller (BioSpherix, Parish, NY, United States)\nwith a hypoxia C-chamber]. The cells were stabilized by the\naddition RNAprotect reagent (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD,\nUnited States) and total RNA was purified using a RNeasy Protect\nBacteria Mini Kit (QIAGEN) from three biological replicates of\neach strain cultured under control conditions and in exudates.\nThe quality assessment of the extracted RNA samples was\nperformed with a NanoDrop OneC Spectrophotometer (Thermo\nFisher Scientific) and a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies)\nand revealed A260/A280 and A260/A230 values of > 2.0 and a mean\nRNA integrity numbers (RIN) value of > 9.2.\nThree biological replicates of RNA samples were shipped on\ndry ice to the DOE Joint Genome Institute (Walnut Creek, CA,\nUnited States), where rRNA was depleted and stranded RNASeq\nlibraries were prepared, quantified by qPCR and sequenced\nusing a HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina). The fastq file reads\nwere filtered and processed with BBDuk1 to remove reads that\ncontained 1 or more “N” bases, had an average quality score\nacross the read less than 10 or had a minimum length < 51 bp\nor 33% of the full read length. Reads mapped with BBMap (see\ntext footnote 2) to masked human, cat, dog, and mouse references\nat 93% identity were removed. Another category of removed\nsequences matched RNA spike-in, PhiX, common microbial\ncontaminants, and ribosomal RNAs. The processed reads from\neach library were aligned to the reference genome using BBMap\nwith only unique mappings allowed (BAMs/directory). If a\nread mapped to more than one location it was ignored.\nfeatureCounts (Liao et al., 2014) was used to generate raw\ngene counts, which were normalized to adjust for the length of\neach gene and total number of reads mapped for each library.\nThe normalization formula used: n = [r/(l/1,000)]/(t/1,000,000),\nwhere n = normalized read count for gene (G) for library (L);\nr = raw read count for gene G for library L; l = gene G length; and\nt = total reads mapped for library L. Raw gene counts were used to\nevaluate the level of correlation between biological samples using\nPearson’s correlation.\nBioinformatic Analysis\nCount tables generated by the JGI RNA-Seq pipeline were input\ninto DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) to normalize and determine\n1https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/\ndifferential expression. Statistical significance was established\nthrough DESeq2 by using three biological replicates for control\nand root exudate conditions. Scatterplots were generated from\nthe DESeq2 data table outputs using ggplot2. Genes differentially\nexpressed between control and root exudate samples (log2 foldchanges\n–2 \u2000 to \u2000 2, adjusted p value \u2000 0.05) were used in\ndownstream analysis. The core genome and pangenome for the\nPseudomonas strains used in this study were computed using the\nOthoMCL v.2.0, Species Tree Builder v.2.2.0, and Phylogenetic\nPangenome Accumulation v1.4.0 apps implemented in the U.S.\nDepartment of Energy Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase)\n(Arkin et al., 2018). Additional comparisons were conducted\nwith the PGAweb pangenome analysis pipeline (Chen et al.,\n2018). Differentially expressed genes were assigned to core,\nnon-core, and singleton parts of each strain’s proteome by\nBLASTp with an E value cutoff of e-06, identity of 40%\nand coverage of 60%. Functional annotation of differentially\nexpressed genes was carried out with the Blast2GO (Conesa\nand Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al.,\n2018). Additional manual curation was performed using tools\nimplemented in the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG)\ndatabase (Markowitz et al., 2012), Pseudomonas Genome\nDatabase (Winsor et al., 2009), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and\nGenomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa et al., 2008), and Geneious 10.2.3\n(Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand). Metabolic functions\nencoded by the differentially expressed genes were mapped\nusing iPath 3.0 (Darzi et al., 2018). Phylogenetic analyses\nwere carried out by building multiple sequence alignments\nwith MAFFT v7.222 (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and inferring\nneighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenies with Geneious Tree Builder.\nThe resultant phylogenetic trees were visualized with iTOL\n(Letunic and Bork, 2016). Reproducibility of clades within the\ninferred NJ trees was assessed by bootstrap resampling with\n1,000 replicates.\nCharacterization of Carbon Source\nUtilization With Biolog Phenotype\nMicroarrays\nThe utilization of carbon sources was analyzed using Phenotype\nMicroArrays (Biolog, Hayward, CA, United States) as follows.\nThe bacteria were cultured overnight on Luria-Bertani agar\nat 25\u2000C, after which cells were harvested and suspended in\ninoculating fluid (IF-0). The transmittance of the suspension\nwas adjusted to 42% using a Biolog turbidimeter. The cell\nsuspension was mixed with IF\U001000000 containing Dye Mix A\n(Biolog) to achieve a final transmittance of 85%. One hundred\nmicroliter aliquots of the adjusted cell suspension were\ninoculated into PM01 and PM02A plates, which were then\nincubated in an OmniLog Phenotype MicroArray System\n(Biolog) at 25\u2000C for 48 h. The formation of formazan was\nrecorded at 15 min intervals, and data were analyzed using\nOmniLog Parametric Analysis software v1.20.02 (Biolog).\nRelative growth of the studied strains was normalized to\ngrowth on D-glucose and visualized using Heatmapper\n(Babicki et al., 2016).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 4 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nData Availability\nSequences generated in this project were deposited\nunder NCBI BioProject accession numbers PRJNA439743\nthrough PRJNA439790.\nRESULTS\nMetabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates\nof B. distachyon\nMetabolomics analysis of lyophilized root exudates revealed\nthe presence of numerous plant metabolites, 86 of which were\nidentified by matching their spectra to the LECO/Fiehn\nMetabolomics library (Supplementary Table 3). These\nmetabolites included (i) carbohydrates and their derivatives\n(glucose, fructose, xylose, sucrose, trehalose, maltose, galactose,\nand others); (ii) sugar alcohols (b-mannosylglycerate, myoinositol,\ngalactinol, 2-deoxyerythritol, ribitol, threitol and\ncellobitol); (iii) amino acids and derivatives (glutamine,\ntyrosine, glutamic acid, asparagine, aspartic acid, valine,\nphenylalanine, isoleucine, glycine, serine, proline, leucine,\ntryptophan, cysteine, methionine, citrulline, and others); (iv)\norganic acids (aconitic, allantoic, g-aminobutyric, azelaic, citric,\nfumaric, 2-furoic, D-glyceric, 3-hydroxypropionic, a-ketoadipic,\nmalic, methylmalonic, nicotinic, quinic, succinic, threonic);\nand (v) assorted metabolites including heterocyclic compounds,\nphenolics, and biogenic amines, etc (3-hydroxypyridine,\nmaleimide, noradrenaline, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoate,\n5-methoxytryptamine, uracil, aminomalonic acid, palmitic acid,\nand urea). Results of the analysis also revealed that root exudates\nof B. distachyon contain hydroxyectoine and the quaternary\namine (QA) glycine betaine (Supplementary Figure 1).\nPhylogenetic and Pangenome Analyses\nof Pseudomonas Strains Used in the\nStudy\nWe used a set of phylogenetic markers suggested by Mulet et al.\n(2010) to investigate the relatedness of the eight strains used in\nthis study to distinct lineages recognized within the P. fluorescens\nspecies complex. The multilocus sequence analysis based on\nthe concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S\nrRNA), gyrB, rpoB, and rpoD identified R1-43-08 (along with\nstrains 2-79 and SBW25) as a member of the P. fluorescens\nsubgroup (Figure 1). The rest of the strains clustered closely with\nfour additional subgroups of the P. fluorescens complex, namely\nP. corrugata (strains Q2-87 and Q8r1-96), P. koreensis (Pf0-1),\nP. protegens (Pf-5), and P. chlororaphis (30–84). The genomes of\nthe eight rhizosphere Pseudomonas strains varied in size by 1.43\nmegabase (ranging from 5.65 to 7.07 Mb) and contained between\n5,166 and 6,363 protein-coding genes (Figure 2A). The shared\ngene content was characterized with OrthoMCL, which uses allagainst-\nall BLASTp followed by the Markov Cluster algorithm to\nidentify protein groups shared between the compared genomes,\nas well as groups representing species-specific gene expansion\nfamilies (Li et al., 2003). The pangenome analysis revealed a\ncore comprised of approximately 3,179 orthologs that were\nshared among all strains and represented 50.0% to 61.5%\nof each predicted proteome (Figures 2A,B). The non-core\npangenome contained genes shared by two or more (but not\nall) strains and contained between 1,482 and 2,080 orthologs,\nwhich corresponded to 28.7–36.3% of individual proteomes. The\nrest of the predicted protein-coding genes were strain-specific\nsingletons that comprised 7.5% to 15.1% of the strain’s predicted\nproteomes. In respect to divergence from the core genome, strain\nPf-5 was found to possess the highest proportion of unique genes\n(n = 949) followed by 2-79 (n = 887). The entire pangenome of\nthe Pseudomonas strains encompassed over 12,000 homolog and\nsingleton gene families.\nFurther homolog family-based comparisons identified Q8r1-\n96 and R1-43-08 as the most distantly related strains, with\n3349 shared homologs (Supplementary Table 4A). Q8r1-96 and\nQ2-87, which shared 4,489 homologs, were the most closely\nrelated strains. The partitioning of homolog gene families into\nthe core, non-core, and singleton parts of the pangenome agreed\nwith phylogenetic relationships of the strains deduced from the\nanalysis of a selected subset of COGs (Clusters of Orthologous\nGroups) (Figure 2C and Supplementary Tables 4B,C). The\nCOG-based phylogeny supported the multilocus sequence\nanalysis and revealed that the eight Pseudomonas strains form\nthree distinct clusters, the first of which contained 2-79, R1-30-\n84, and SBW25. The second cluster included Q8r1-96 and Q2-87,\nwhereas the third encompassed strains 30-84, Pf-5, and Pf0-1.\nCorrelating the Composition of Root\nExudates With Metabolic Profiles of\nPseudomonas Strains\nWe used the Phenotype MicroArray PM1 and PM2 plates to\nprofile the eight Pseudomonas strains for the utilization of\n190 different carbon sources. Results of the analysis identified\n90 compounds that supported growth and clustered by their\nintensities of utilization into three distinct groups (Figure 3).\nGroup I was comprised of 30 highly metabolized carbon\nsources, which included several amino acids and intermediates of\nglycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, and citrate cycle. Approximately\nhalf of these compounds were catabolized by all eight strains,\nand included several organic acids (fumaric, citric, gluconic,\nmalic, and pyroglutamic), amino acids (Glu, Asn, Gln, Asp, Pro,\nAla, and g-aminobutyric acid), carbohydrates (glucose, mannose,\nand mannitol), and the purine nucleoside inosine. Group II\nwas composed of 44 chemically diverse carbon sources that\nwere variably utilized by the strains. These compounds were\ncarbohydrates, organic acids, amino acids, phenolics, and polyols,\nand included known compatible solutes and intermediates of\nmetabolism of pentoses, galactose, starch, and sucrose. Group\nIII encompassed the rest of the Phenotype MicroArray test\npanel and contained compounds that were not catabolized\nby the tested strains. Among several notable exceptions were\na-hydroxyglutamic acid- g-lactone, putrescine, and itaconic,\ncitramalic, and succinamic acids, which supported the growth\nof strains 2-79, 30-84, Pf-5, and SBW25.

The phylogeny was established based on the concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S rRNA), gyrB (subunit B of DNA\ngyrase), rpoB (b subunit of RNA polymerase), and rpoD (sigma 70 factor subunit of RNA polymerase).

Interestingly, many carbon sources from\nthe Phenotype MicroArray panel were also present in the root\nexudates of B. distachyon Bd21, and some of these compounds\n(glucose, mannose, galactose, fructose, g-aminobutyric acid,\naspartic acid, citric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, quinic acid,\nalanine, glutamine, and glutamic acid) were catabolized by all\nstrains used in this study, while others (e.g., xylose, trehalose,\nm-inositol) were actively utilized only by certain organisms\n(Figure 3). The comparison of catabolic profiles across the\neight studied Pseudomonas strains revealed the presence of three\ndistinct clusters. The first cluster contained strains Q8r1-96 and\nQ2-87, which consumed very similar sets of carbon sources,\nas well as strain Pf0-1. The second cluster was composed of\n2-79, R1-43-08, SBW25, and 30-84, whereas the third cluster\nwas represented by a single strain, Pf-5. The overall similarity\nof the catabolic profiles partially agreed with the separation\nof the strains into different subgroups of the P. fluorescens\ncomplex (see above).\nAnalysis of the RNA-seq Results\nIn order to understand the cellular responses of rhizosphere\nPseudomonas to plant exometabolites, we analyzed the\ntranscriptome changes in cultures grown in the presence of\nroot exudates. Under field conditions, rhizobacteria colonize\nplant roots in the form of surface-attached microaerobic biofilms\n(Hojberg et al., 1999). To mimic these conditions, the eight\nPseudomonas strains were grown statically at 72% air saturation\nin 21C-glucose medium amended with root exudates and then\nprocessed to extract total RNA (Supplementary Figure 2).\nA total of 995 million raw sequencing reads were generated from\nthe RNA samples by using the Illumina HiSeq-2500 platform,\naveraging 20.7 million reads per sample. The removal of lowquality\nand rRNA sequences resulted in a total of 793 million\nfiltered reads that were mapped onto the eight Pseudomonas\ngenomes with a mean of 7.48 million mapped fragments per\ngenome. The differentially abundant transcripts were identified\nby setting a p value of 0.05 (adjusted for multiple testing) and\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 6 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

The input order was randomized to avoid any\nbias due to the sequential addition of new genomes. The pangenome size increases steadily without reaching a plateau even after the addition of 11,939\nnon-redundant gene families. At the same time, the core genome converged to 3,179 genes. (C) The pangenome-based phylogenomic analysis of the studied\nstrains. Here, the pangenome was defined with OrthoMCL, and orthologous gene sets were then partitioned into the core, singleton, and non-core (the remaining\northolog sets) categories. These categories were calculated for each node in the Maximum Likelihood species tree, using the set of genomes for which that node\nrepresents the ancestor. The results of the ortholog partitioning are shown in pie charts placed at tree nodes. Numbers indicate bootstrap support values. The\nanalysis was conducted in KBase (Arkin et al., 2018).\nthe log2 fold-change (FC) threshold \u2000\u2000 2.0 (Figure 4 and\nSupplementary Tables 5–12). When compared with the control\nconditions, an average of 204 genes per strain were differentially\nexpressed in the presence of root exudates, with the highest\n(n = 425) and lowest (n = 112) numbers observed, respectively,\nin SBW25 and Q2-87 (Figure 4). Overall, more genes were\ninduced than repressed in response to exudates, but the actual\nnumbers in each category varied substantially depending on the\nidentity of the Pseudomonas strain. In most strains, the bulk of\nthe differentially expressed genes was almost equally distributed\nbetween the core (mean, 48.2%) and non-core (mean, 45.8%)\nparts of the genome, whereas the strain-specific singleton genes\nconstituted on average only 5.9% (Figure 4B). One notable\nexception was observed in Q8r1-96, where all differentially\nexpressed genes belonged to the core (73.8%) and non-core\n(26.2%) parts of the genome. Another notable pattern was\nobserved in R1-43-08, where the majority of genes affected by\nthe presence of root exudate fell into the non-core category\n(56.3%). The highest proportion of differentially expressed\nsingletons (11.3 and 10.4%, respectively) was identified in\nstrains SBW25 and Pf-5.\nWe further explored how the identified differentially\nexpressed genes were distributed across genomes of the eight\nstudied rhizosphere strains. The pairwise BLASTp comparisons\nidentified 2-79 and SBW25 as two strains that shared the highest\nnumber of genes (n = 101) induced or repressed in response\nto root exudates (Table 1). The second pair of strains with\na significant number of similar differentially expressed genes\n(n = 86) was Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, which was followed by Pf0-1\nand 30-84, which shared 56 differentially expressed genes. These\npatterns of shared genes were also observed when the results of\nthe pairwise BLASTp comparisons were converted into a binary\ngene presence/absence matrix, which was then subjected to\ncluster analysis using a UPGMA algorithm based on Sorensen’s\ndissimilarity index or examined by non-metric multidimensional\nscaling (NMDS) (Figure 5).\nThe differentially expressed Pseudomonas genes were\nsubjected to Blast2Go analysis and Gene Ontology (GO)\nannotation (Figure 6). Metabolic process, catalytic activity,\nand membrane were the most common annotation terms\nacross the three primary GO term categories (i.e., biological\nprocess, molecular function, and cellular component). A total\nof 1,694 GO terms was assigned to 805 upregulated genes, with\nthe majority of the GO terms related to molecular function\n(682, 40.3%), followed by biological process (669, 39.5%), and\ncellular component (343, 20.2%). In the 539 downregulated gene\ncategory, 1,101 GO terms were assigned to biological process\n(420, 38.1%), molecular function (417, 37.9%), and cellular\ncomponent (264, 24.0%). Within biological process, metabolic\nprocess, cellular process, localization, response to stimulus, and\nregulation were over-represented. Within molecular function,\nthe largest proportion was assigned to catalytic activity, binding,\nand transporter activity categories. Within cellular component,\nthe majority were assigned to membrane, membrane part, cell,\nand cell part categories. Across the eight strains, 37–42% of\ndifferentially expressed genes had no Gene Ontology IDs and\nencoded various conserved hypothetical proteins.\nFunctional Classification of Shared\nDifferentially Expressed Genes\nThe interrogation of RNA-seq data revealed multiple cellular\npathways that were differentially regulated in bacterial cultures\nincubated with root exudates (Supplementary Figures 3, 4).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 7 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nFIGURE 3 | Biolog Phenotype MicroArray profiling the eight rhizosphere\nPseudomonas strains used in the study. The hierarchical clustering analysis\nwas carried out using the average linkage method with Euclidean distances.\nCarbon sources identified by red arrowheads were also detected in the sterile\nroot exudates of B. distachyon Bd21.\nAlthough none of these differentially regulated pathways were\nshared by all eight strains, the cross-strain comparisons revealed\nseveral types of common and specific transcriptomic responses\nthat were elicited by the presence of plant exometabolites\n(Table 2). The visual representation of core gene expression\npatterns is provided in Supplementary Figure 5, which\nshows heatmaps of expression profiles and p-adj values for\ncore genes shared by the studied strains. The figure is\naccompanied by Supplementary Table 13 that lists predicted\nfunctions of genes constituting the four distinct clusters\nobserved after hierarchical clustering of gene expression\nvalues. The first category of shared differentially expressed\npathways functioned in the uptake and catabolism of selected\ncarbohydrates, quaternary ammonium compounds (QAs), and\nphenolics. All strains except for R1-43-08, responded to root\nexudates by inducing the fructose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate\n(PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTSFru). The\ncomponents of this system are encoded by a conserved\noperon and include the cytoplasmic polyprotein EI/HPr/EIIAFru\n(FruB), the 1-phosphofructokinase FruK, and the fructosespecific\npermease EIIBC (FruA) (Chavarria et al., 2016). The\nPTSFru system functions by acquiring high-energy phosphates\nfrom PEP and sequentially passing them, via the EI/HPr/EIIAFru\ndomains of FruB, to the EIIB component of FruA. The\nphosphates are ultimately transferred by the EIIC transporter\nto fructose yielding fructose 1-phosphate, which is channeled\ninto the central metabolic pathways through the action of the\nphosphofructokinase FruK.\nIn all strains except for Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, the exposure to root\nexudates resulted in the induction of two genes adjacent to the\nfru cluster that encoded a Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS)\ntransporter and an L-arabinonate dehydratase (Table 2). These\ngenes are predicted to participate in the uptake and catabolism\nof L-arabinose, where L-arabinonate dehydratase plays an\nimportant role by converting L-arabinonate to 2-dehydro-3-\ndeoxy-L-arabinonate (Rahman et al., 2017). In SBW25, R1-\n43-08, and Q2-87, we also observed the induction of genes\nencoding components of the AraFGH complex, an ATP-Binding\nCassette (ABC) superfamily transporter involved in the import of\narabinose into the cell (Supplementary Tables 6, 7, 9). Finally, all\nstrains except SBW25 and R1-43-08 responded to the presence\nof exudates by upregulating a conserved gene encoding an\naldose epimerase superfamily protein. Such enzymes equilibrate\nalpha- and beta-anomers of aldoses and ensure that stereospecific\nenzymes involved in the metabolism of free sugars do not act as\nmetabolic bottlenecks (Abayakoon et al., 2018). Although some\naldose epimerases have been linked to specific pathways, the\nPseudomonas gene identified in this study could not be assigned\nto a particular metabolic process based on sequence analysis and\ngenomic location.\nSeveral Pseudomonas strains responded to the presence\nof root exudates by upregulating genes involved in the\nuptake and catabolism of myo-inositol and possibly other\nstereoisomers of inositol (Table 2). The upregulated catabolic\ngenes encode the dehydrogenase IolG, which oxidizes myoinositol\nto its corresponding ketone, as well as IolE, IolD, IolB,\nand IolC that collectively convert the 2-keto-myo-inositol to\nacetyl-CoA and the glycolysis intermediate dihydroxyacetone\nphosphate (Yoshida et al., 2008; Kohler et al., 2011).

Many of these genes were\ndifferentially expressed, including those encoding parts of the\nABC transporter CbcXWV, which is predicted to function in\nthe uptake of choline under water-replete conditions (Table 2).\nAmong enzymes induced in the presence of root exudates were\nthe choline dehydrogenase BetA, which converts choline to\nglycine betaine and a network of enzymes (i.e., the Rieske family\noxygenase GbcAB, the dimethyglycine demethylase DgcAB, and\nthe sarcosine oxidase SoxBDAG) that sequentially convert GB\nto glycine. In 2-79 and SBW25, this group of differentially\nregulated genes also included an AraC-family transcriptional\nactivator GbdR, which perceives intercellular levels of GB and\ninduces genes involved in the transport and catabolism of\nglycine betaine and detoxification of the catabolic byproducts\n(Hampel et al., 2014).\nThe last category of activated catabolic pathways included the\ncatechol branch of the b-ketoadipate pathway for the degradation\nof aromatic compounds. In strains 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5,\ngrowth on root exudates resulted in upregulation of catechol-\n1,2-dioxygenase, muconate cycloisomerase, and muconolactone\nisomerase, which collectively cleave the catechol ring and\nconvert it to b-ketoadipate enol-lactone (Harwood and Parales,\n1996). Finally, analysis of the P. synxantha 2-79 transcriptome\nidentified an induction of benABC genes encoding subunits\nof benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase, an oxidoreductase that generates\ncatechol from benzoate.\nIn addition to various catabolic pathways, the exposure to root\nexudates also induced several genes involved in the homeostasis\nof copper (Table 2). Four of these genes form a conserved cluster\nin genomes of the strains and encode the periplasmic coppersensing\ntwo-component system CinRS, the plastocyanin/azurinlike\nprotein CinA, and the NADPH-dependent pre-Q0 reductase\nCinQ. Also, in strains Q2-87, 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, we observed\nupregulation of a conserved operon encoding the multicopper\noxidase CopA, the periplasmic copper-binding protein CopC, the\ninner membrane protein CopD, and outer membrane protein\nCopB. In several Gram-negative bacteria, these Cop proteins are\nthought to have dual functions and participate both in the uptake\nof essential copper as well as in the sequestration of excess copper\nin the periplasm and outer membrane.\nThe analysis of shared downregulated pathways revealed that\nmost of the strains respond to the presence of root exudates by\nrepressing genes involved in the uptake and catabolism of sulfur\ncompounds (Table 2). In strains SBW25, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96,\nQ2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, this response involved the ssuEADCB\noperon responsible for the utilization of alkanesulfonates\nas sulfur sources. The ssu operon is highly conserved in\nfluorescent pseudomonads and encodes the FMNH2-dependent\nmonooxygenase SsuD and the NAD (P)H-dependent FMN\nreductase SsuE, which together catalyze the desulfonation of\nalkanesulfonates. Also, the ssu locus contains genes for the\nmolybdopterin-binding protein SsuF and the alkanesulfonatespecific\nABC-type transporter consisting of the sulfonate\nsubstrate-binding protein SsuA, sulfonate permease protein\nSsuC, and sulfonate transport ATP-binding protein SsuB. Finally,\nin R1-43-08, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, growth on root exudates\ncoincided with repression of the tauABCD operon, which\nallows these strains to utilize taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonate)\nas a sulfur source. The repressed tau genes encoded the\n2-oxoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenase TauD and\nsubstrate-binding, ATP-binding, and permease components of\nthe taurine-specific ABC transporter TauABC.\nOther Differentially Expressed Pathways\nIn addition to their effect on several shared cellular pathways,\ngrowth on root exudates resulted in the induction or repression of\nnumerous strain-specific genes. In closely related P. synxantha 2-\n79 and P. fluorescens SBW25, we observed differential expression\nof genes involved in energy metabolism, transport of amino\nacids, and surface attachment (Supplementary Tables 5, 6).\nOther notable differentially expressed pathways included 2–\n79 gene clusters that encode enzymes for the catabolism of\ntrehalose, a prophage, and toxin/antitoxin system, as well as the\nSBW25 operon predicted to control the synthesis of the capsular\nexopolysaccharide colonic acid. The response of Pseudomonas sp.\nR1-43-08 to root exudates also involved differential expression\nof different energy metabolism pathways. In addition, we\nobserved the upregulation of genes involved in the uptake and\ncatabolism of xylose (also upregulated in 2–79) and repression\nof enzymes for the biosynthesis of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid\nand assimilation of inorganic sulfur and L-cysteine biosynthesis\n(Supplementary Table 7).\nThe analysis of the Q8r1-96 transcriptome revealed\nperturbation of different metabolic pathways including genes\nencoding components of cytochrome C oxidase, transport\nand catabolism of sorbitol/mannitol, metabolism of butanoic\nacid, and biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides alginate and\npoly-b-1-6-N-acetylglucosamine (Supplementary Table 8). In\nP. fluorescens Q2-87, we identified differential expression of\ngenes involved in metabolism of galactose, tryptophan, tyrosine,\nglycine, serine, and threonine (Supplementary Table 9),\nwhile in P. chlororaphis 30-84, growth on exudates activated\nthe biosynthesis of molybdopterin cofactor, catabolism of\ngalactonate and acetoin, and uptake and catabolism of putrescine\n(Supplementary Table 10). The response of P. protegens Pf-5 to\nroot exudates involved upregulation of acetoin dehydrogenase,\nwhich converts acetoin to acetaldehyde and acetyl-CoA, as\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 10 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

On a WEGO histogram, the percentage of 100 is defined as the total number of genes assigned a GO\nterm. However, the subcategories do not add up to 100% because many genes fall into more than one functional class and are therefore annotated by multiple GO\nterms.\nwell as pathways for the utilization of glycolate and putrescine\n(Supplementary Table 11). Also induced were genes for\nthe production of pyrrolnitrin and PhlG hydrolase, which\nmodulate the metabolic loads attributed to the synthesis of\n2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol. The differentially expressed genes of\nP. fluorescens Pf0-1 included, among others, operons encoding\ncytochrome C oxidase and enzymes for catabolism of malonic\nacid (Supplementary Table 12). Yet another interesting\nfinding involved the induction of assorted genes acting in the\nhomeostasis of iron and defense against reactive oxygen species\n(ROS). We observed activation of iron dicitrate transporters\n(SBW25 and 30-84), genes for the biosynthesis of siderophores\nornicorrugatin (SBW25) and pyochelin (Pf-5), heme-degrading\nenzymes (2–79, 30–84), TonB siderophore receptors, and\ncomponents of the energy-transducing inner membrane\ncomplex TonB-ExbB-ExbD (2–79 and Pf-5). The differentially\nexpressed ROS defense pathways were represented by different\ncatalases in strains 2–79, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and\nPf-5 and organic hydroperoxide resistance proteins in strains\nSBW25 and R1-43-08. Finally, in SBW25, Q2-87, 30–84, and\nPf0-1, the addition of exudates resulted in the upregulation of\nperoxiredoxins that detoxify H2O2, peroxynitrite, and aliphatic\nand aromatic hydroperoxides.\nDISCUSSION\nOur analysis of B. distachyon root exudates revealed a complex\nmix of primary and secondary metabolites, thus supporting\nthe view of the plant rhizosphere as a carbon-rich niche for\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 11 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nsoil microorganisms. Our results were in agreement with a\nrecent report of 27 different sugars, amino acids, and organic\nacids in Brachypodium exudates (Kawasaki et al., 2016). We\nconfirmed the presence of exometabolites identified in that\nstudy, along with dozens of additional analytes that were\nidentified by matching their mass-spectra and retention indices\nto the LECO/Fiehn Metabolomics library (Supplementary\nTable 3). The complementation of the metabolomic analysis\nwith profiling of the bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays\nrevealed that a substantial proportion of the characterized\nexudate constituents were catabolized by a collection of eight\nPseudomonas strains from across the P. fluorescens group that is\nknown to form associations with plant roots. The amendment\nof Pseudomonas cultures with root exudates caused changes in\nthe expression of multiple genes encoding catabolic and anabolic\nenzymes, predicted transporters, transcriptional regulators, stress\nresponse, and conserved hypothetical proteins. In most strains,\nthese differentially expressed genes were almost equally split\nbetween the core and variable genome regions, mirroring\nthe substantial strain-to-strain variation in the genome size\nand gene content within the P. fluorescens species complex\n(Loper et al., 2012).\nThe analysis of transcriptome responses to root exudates\nrevealed several types of cellular pathways present in the strains\nused in this study. The first category of such pathways was\ninvolved in the catabolism of carbohydrates such as fructose,\narabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, trehalose, and galactose. Among\nthese catabolic traits, the ability to utilize fructose as a carbon\nsource is highly conserved among fluorescent pseudomonads.\nIn contrast, growth on arabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, and\ntrehalose is variably present and was traditionally used to\ndifferentiate species and biovars within the P. fluorescens\ngroup (Barrett et al., 1986). We speculate that such variably\ndistributed pathways contribute to the differential affinity of\npseudomonads toward host plants and/or to determine which\nstrains flourish in response to growing roots and changing\nenvironments. Several independent studies have confirmed\nthe importance of carbohydrate catabolism pathways for the\nbiology of rhizosphere pseudomonads. For example, in vivo\nexpression technology (IVET) profiling of P. fluorescens SBW25\nidentified xylose isomerase among genome regions essential\nfor the colonization of sugar beet seedlings (Liu et al., 2015),\nwhereas a genome-wide Tn-Seq screen of Pseudomonas simiae\nidentified genes for the catabolism of myo-inositol among traits\nessential for the colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana roots\n(Cole et al., 2017).\nThe response of rhizosphere Pseudomonas to Brachypodium\nroot exudates also involved pathways for the uptake and\nmetabolism of amino acids. We observed differential\nexpression of genes encoding the hydrophobic (HAAT) and\npolar (PAAT) amino acid uptake transporters in strains\n2-79, SBW25, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5. Other related genes\nencoded enzymes for the catabolism of valine and glutamic\nacid (2-79); metabolism of tryptophan, glycine, serine, and\nthreonine (Q2-87); and biosynthesis of methionine (Q8r1-\n96). It is plausible that the abundance of amino acids in\nroot exudates is also linked to the repression of pathways\ninvolved in the catabolism of sulfonates and taurine that\nwas observed in several strains (Table 2). Although the\npreferred source of sulfur for P. fluorescens is unknown, in the\nclosely related P. aeruginosa, the sulfur starvation response\nis triggered by the growth on any sulfur compound other\nthan sulfate, thiocyanate, and cysteine (Hummerjohann et al.,\n1998). This fact, together with the presence of cysteine and\ncystine in the root exudates, suggest that root exudates of\nBrachypodium may serve as an important source of sulfur for\nrhizosphere Pseudomonas. These findings also agree well with\nthe reported scarcity of inorganic sulfate in the soil, and the\npresence of sulfur mostly in the form of organic compounds,\nincluding amino acids, proteins, sulfate esters, and sulfonates\n(Autry and Fitzgerald, 1990).\nAnother interesting result of this study was the concerted\nactivation of copper and iron homeostasis pathways observed\nin all of the Pseudomonas strains used in this work. In bacteria,\nan excess of copper is toxic and triggers oxidative stress due to\nthe formation of free radicals, as well as disruption of protein\nmetalation and stability of iron-sulfur clusters (Bondarczuk\nand Piotrowska-Seget, 2013). On the other hand, copper is an\nessential trace element used as a cofactor in different enzymes.\nSimilarly, although elevated levels of iron cause redox stress, this\nelement is also found in active energy metabolism enzymes and is\ncrucial for bacterial growth (Andrews et al., 2003). The analysis\nof metal homeostasis genes identified in this study suggests\nthat their induction was likely triggered by the deficiency of\ncopper and iron in bacterial cultures grown in the presence of\nroot exudates. We attribute this effect to the ability of some\ncomponents of root exudates to chelate soil metals.\nDespite the abundance of iron in the soil, its bioavailability\nis limited due to the low solubility of Fe (III) oxyhydrates\nat neutral pH. The non-graminaceous plants circumvent this\nproblem by acidifying the rhizosphere and secreting flavins,\nphenolics, and organic acids that chelate iron. The reduction\nof these ferric chelates releases soluble ferrous iron taken up\nby root cells (Kobayashi and Nishizawa, 2012). Graminaceous\nplants, like Brachypodium, acquire iron by secreting into the\nsoil non-protein amino acids of the mugineic acid (MA) group,\nwhich act as Fe (III)-chelating phytosiderophores. In addition to\niron, low-molecular-weight organic acids and phytosiderophores\nbind other divalent and trivalent metals (including copper) and\ncontribute to heavy-metal tolerance in plants (Chen et al., 2017).\nIt is plausible that the presence of these plant exometabolites\nis responsible for the deficit of iron and copper observed in\nPseudomonas cultures grown in the presence of root exudates.\nThese results further underscore the importance of diverse and\nredundant metal homeostasis pathways found in genomes of the\nP. fluorescens group for the ability of these organisms to colonize\nand persist in the plant rhizosphere.\nRecently, Klonowska et al. (2018) examined transcriptomic\nresponses of symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria to root\nexudates of the legume plant Mimosa pundica, which has\nan unusual ability to support both alpha- (Rhizobium) and\nbeta-rhizobia (Cupriavidus and Burkholderia). Using RNA-seq,\nthe authors characterized genes involved in the perception of\nroot exudates in the nodulating bacteria Burkholderia phymatum\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 14 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nSTM815, Cupriavidus taiwanensis LMG19424, and Rhizobium\nmesoamericanum STM3625. Interestingly, the analysis of\ndifferentially expressed genes revealed induction of pathways\ninvolved in the catabolism of fructose, xylose, myo-inositol,\nand protocatechuate/catechol. Also upregulated were some\ncopper homeostasis, siderophore biosynthesis, and oxidative\nstress genes. Finally, the analytical profiling of M. pundica\nexudates revealed an overlap with Brachypodium in the types of\ncarbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids present. These\nfindings suggest that differentially expressed genes shared by\nmultiple strains of the group P. fluorescens are not unique to\nthe Brachypodium-Pseudomonas system but represent a set\nof conserved cellular pathways involved in the perception of\nplant exometabolites by different clades of rhizosphere-dwelling\nProteobacteria.\nMost strains included in this study were originally selected\nbased on the ability to colonize the rhizosphere and produce\nsecondary metabolites that alleviate the plant stress response\nand/or inhibit soilborne pathogens. It has been suggested\nthat plant metabolites released into the rhizosphere affect\nthe biocontrol activity of plant-beneficial pseudomonads (de\nWerra et al., 2011). We provide further support to this\nhypothesis by demonstrating that in some strains, root exudates\nmodulate the expression of genes for the catabolism of\nthe plant growth-promoting metabolites acetoin and 2,3-\nbutanediol. The exposure to exudates also affected the expression\nof genes for the synthesis of well-characterized antifungal\ncompounds pyrrolnitrin, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, and 2,4-\ndiacetylphloroglucinol. The modulatory effects were strainspecific,\nsuggesting significant differences in the regulatory\nnetworks involved in the perception of plant signals and\nregulation of the production of antibiotics and growthpromoting\nmetabolites.\nThe final significant finding of this study was the induction\nof catabolism of quaternary amines (QAs) observed in multiple\nstrains of the P. fluorescens group during growth on root\nexudates. This observation was supported by the detection of\nglycine betaine in the root secretions of B. distachyon. The\npresence of QAs in plant tissues and the capacity of these\nmetabolites to provide stress protection and nutrients to plant\npathogens and symbionts were reported before (Boncompagni\net al., 1999; Chen et al., 2013; Kabbadj et al., 2017), but our\nstudy is among the first to highlight the potential importance of\nthese metabolites for rhizosphere interactions. Pseudomonads do\nnot synthesize QAs de novo but have evolved many pathways to\nscavenge them from eukaryotic hosts, where these metabolites\nare abundant due to the prominence of phosphatidylcholine\nin cellular membranes. Strains of P. fluorescens carry genes\nfor the conversion of choline, carnitine, and glycine betaine to\nglycine, as well as quaternary amine transporters of the BCCT\nand ABC families that are also conserved in the opportunistic\nhuman pathogen P. aeruginosa and the plant pathogen P. syringae\n(Galvao et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2013; Wargo, 2013b).\nIn P. aeruginosa, choline catabolism genes are essential for\nthe ability of this pathogen to persist during lung infection\n(Wargo, 2013a). Similarly, a P. syringae mutant deficient in\nBetT, OpuC, and CbcXWV quaternary amine transporters had\nreduced fitness during colonization of bean and soybean leaves\nunder greenhouse and field conditions (Chen et al., 2013).\nDepending on water availability, P. aeruginosa and P. syringae\ncatabolize exogenously supplied QAs as carbon and nitrogen\nsources or accumulate them as osmoprotectants (Chen et al.,\n2013; Wargo, 2013b). Our ongoing work in P. synxantha 2–\n79 unraveled similar physiological responses and demonstrated\nthat QA transporters function differentially and redundantly\nin the uptake of quaternary amines as nutrients (Pablo and\nMavrodi, unpublished). In contrast, under water stress, the QAs\ncholine, betaine, and carnitine are accumulated preferentially for\nosmoprotection. Under drought stress, a 2–79 mutant devoid\nof all known QA transporters was less competitive in the\ncolonization of the Brachypodium rhizosphere than its wild-type\nparental strain. Interestingly, our metabolomic profiling of root\nexudates also revealed proline, glutamine, and hydroxyectoine.\nThese metabolites act as compatible solutes in different groups\nof microorganisms (Yancey et al., 1982; Empadinhas and da\nCosta, 2008), suggesting an important role of root exudates\nin the ability of Pseudomonas to persist in the rhizosphere of\ndrought-stressed plants.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe original contributions presented in the study are publicly\navailable.

Plant roots secrete carbon-rich rhizodeposits containing primary and\nsecondary low molecular weight metabolites, lysates, and mucilages. These exudates\nprovide nutrients for soil microorganisms and modulate their affinity to host plants, but\nmolecular details of this process are largely unresolved. We addressed this gap by\nfocusing on the molecular dialog between eight well-characterized beneficial strains\nof the Pseudomonas fluorescens group and Brachypodium distachyon, a model for\neconomically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops of the grass family. We\ncollected and analyzed root exudates of B. distachyon and demonstrated the presence\nof multiple carbohydrates, amino acids, organic acids, and phenolic compounds. The\nsubsequent screening of bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays revealed that many\nof these metabolites provide carbon and energy for the Pseudomonas strains. RNAseq\nprofiling of bacterial cultures amended with root exudates revealed changes in the\nexpression of genes encoding numerous catabolic and anabolic enzymes, transporters,\ntranscriptional regulators, stress response, and conserved hypothetical proteins. Almost\nhalf of the differentially expressed genes mapped to the variable part of the strains’\npangenome, reflecting the importance of the variable gene content in the adaptation of\nP. fluorescens to the rhizosphere lifestyle. Our results collectively reveal the diversity\nof cellular pathways and physiological responses underlying the establishment of\nmutualistic interactions between these beneficial rhizobacteria and their plant hosts.\nKeywords: Pseudomonas, Brachypodium, rhizosphere, root exudates, transcriptome\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 1 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nINTRODUCTION\nPlants are meta-organisms or holobionts that rely in part on\ntheir microbiome for specific functions and traits. The ability\nof the plant microbiome to influence plant development, vigor,\nhealth, and fitness in response to abiotic stressors associated\nwith global climate change is documented by numerous studies\n(Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009). There is mounting evidence\nthat plants actively recruit beneficial microbiomes, but many\naspects of this process are still very much a black box (Reinhold-\nHurek et al., 2015). The foundation for the differential affinity\nof rhizobacteria toward host plants is built upon complex\nchemical cross talk between microorganisms and plant roots.\nUp to 40% of photosynthetically fixed carbon is released by\nplant roots in the form of exudates and secretions, lysates, and\nmucilages (Curl and Truelove, 1986; Lynch, 1990; Whipps, 1990;\nBadri and Vivanco, 2009). The release of these compounds is\nactively controlled in response to environmental stimuli, and the\ncomposition of root exudates varies greatly according to plant\nspecies and physiological condition (Lynch, 1990; Nguyen, 2003;\nPhillips et al., 2004; De-la-Pena et al., 2008). The presence and\ncomposition of exudates strongly impact soil microorganisms,\nwhich is consistent with the idea that plants actively select and\nshape their root microbiota (Zolla et al., 2013).\nPrimary root exudates include simple and complex sugars,\namino acids, polypeptides and proteins, organic, aliphatic and\nfatty acids, sterols, and phenolics (Nguyen, 2003; Badri and\nVivanco, 2009; Badri et al., 2009). These compounds serve as\ncarbon and energy sources for rhizobacteria, and the presence\nof the intact corresponding catabolic pathways is essential\nfor competitive colonization of roots and disease suppression\n(Lugtenberg et al., 2001; Kamilova et al., 2005; Lugtenberg and\nKamilova, 2009). Root exudates also contain numerous signal\nmolecules and secondary metabolites, the significance of which\nis only now emerging (Walker et al., 2003; Bais et al., 2005,\n2006). A handful of analyses of plant-induced gene expression\nby transcriptional profiling in vitro (Mark et al., 2005) or in\nthe rhizosphere (Silby and Levy, 2004; Ramos-Gonzalez et al.,\n2005; Matilla et al., 2007; Barret et al., 2009) have identified\nmultiple genes that are differentially regulated by exposure to\nroots or root exudates. Bacterial pathways expressed during\nrhizosphere colonization control utilization of plant-derived\nmetabolites (Simons et al., 1996, 1997; Camacho-Carvajal, 2001;\nLugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), motility and chemotaxis (de\nWeert et al., 2002; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), phase\nvariation (Dekkers et al., 1998; Sanchez-Contreras et al., 2002;\nvan den Broek et al., 2005), outer membrane integrity (de Weert\net al., 2006; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), and the ability\nto sequester limiting resources (Raaijmakers et al., 1995) and\nresist environmental stresses (Sarniguet et al., 1995; Miller and\nWood, 1996; van Veen et al., 1997; Schnider-Keel et al., 2001). In\nits spatial and temporal properties, root colonization resembles\nbiofilm formation, and biofilm-related pathways also have been\nimplicated in adhesion to seeds and roots and rhizosphere\ncolonization (Espinosa-Urgel et al., 2000; Hinsa et al., 2003;\nYousef-Coronado et al., 2008; Fuqua, 2010; Martinez-Gil et al.,\n2010; Nielsen et al., 2011; Zboralski and Filion, 2020). Finally,\nroot exudates strongly affect the expression of diverse plant\ngrowth promotion and biocontrol genes (Vacheron et al., 2013).\nOver the past decade, the genomes of numerous rhizosphere\nstrains have been sequenced and analyzed, but functional\ngenomics studies of rhizosphere competence lag behind the\navailability of sequence data.\nThis study explored the molecular dialog between the\nmodel host plant Brachypodium distachyon and several wellcharacterized\nrhizosphere strains of the Pseudomonas fluorescens\ngroup. Brachypodium is a small annual grass originating in semiarid\nregions of the Middle East that has emerged as a prime model\nfor economically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops\nof the grass family (Bevan et al., 2010; Schwartz et al., 2010;\nBrkljacic et al., 2011; Hong et al., 2011; Tyler et al., 2014). The\nbiology, extensive collection of resources, and research tools\nmake B. distachyon an attractive model to investigate interactions\nbetween plants and root-associated microbes. Pseudomonads\nare ubiquitous Gram-negative g-proteobacteria that colonize\neukaryotic hosts and include both commensals and economically\nimportant pathogens of plants and animals (Moore et al.,\n2006; Schroth et al., 2006; Yahr and Parsek, 2006). The genus\nPseudomonas currently comprises > 100 named species that have\nbeen separated based on multilocus sequence analysis into 14\nspecies groups (Garrido-Sanz et al., 2016; Hesse et al., 2018).\nThe P. fluorescens group is the most diverse regarding both\nthe genetic distances within it, the number of species and the\nlarge pangenome that makes up > 50% of the pangenome\nof the genus as a whole (Loper et al., 2012). The group also\nencompasses an unusually high proportion of strains that inhabit\nthe plant rhizosphere and possess plant growth promoting and\nbiocontrol properties. Naylor et al. (2017) profiled bacterial\ncommunities associated with root tissues and rhizosphere of\n18 different plant species of the Poaceae family. That study\nidentified Pseudomonas among taxa constituting the core grass\nroot microbiome and demonstrated that these bacteria were\nenriched in C3 plants, including wheat, rye, barley, oat, and\nBrachypodium. We confirmed the capacity of B. distachyon\nBd21 to serve as a host for rhizobacteria of the P. fluorescens\ngroup in preliminary greenhouse assays with biocontrol strains\nP. synxantha 2-79, P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96, and P. protegens\nPf-5. Results of these experiments revealed that all strains\nsuccessfully established and colonized the roots of Brachypodium\n(Supplementary Table 1).\nIn this study, we focused on eight well-studied strains\nof the P. fluorescens complex that are supported by years\nof studies, numerous refereed publications, and high-quality\ngenome sequences. By profiling transcriptomes of these strains\nduring growth in root exudates of B. distachyon, we revealed the\ndiversity of cellular pathways and physiological responses that\nunderlie the establishment of mutualistic interactions between\nbeneficial rhizobacteria and the host plant. Our results also\nconfirmed that root exudates contain carbohydrates, amino acids,\norganic acids, and phenolics that serve as carbon and energy\nsources for rhizobacteria. The root exudates also contained\nosmoprotectants that may help microorganisms to persist in the\nrhizosphere of drought-stressed plants.

R1-43-08 (Parejko\net al., 2012), P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96 (Raaijmakers and Weller,\n1998), P. fluorescens Q2-87 (Bangera and Thomashow, 1996),\nP. chlororaphis 30-84 (Thomashow et al., 1990), P. fluorescens\nPf0-1 (Silby et al., 2009), and P. protegens Pf-5 (Howell and\nStipanovic, 1980). The selected organisms have been studied\nextensively for their role in biological control and plant\ngrowth promotion (Supplementary Table 2). The strains were\nmaintained in the laboratory as frozen stocks (\U0010000080\u2000C) and\nroutinely cultured in King’s medium B (King et al., 1954) or\n21C medium, which contained (per 1 L): 1.0 g of NH4Cl, 3.5 g\nof Na2HPO4\u20002H2O, 2.8 g of KH2PO4, 3.0 g of glucose, and\n20 ml of a microelement solution (Smibert and Kreig, 1994;\nHalverson and Firestone, 2000).\nPropagation of Plants and Collection of\nRoot Exudates\nB. distachyon Bd21 was established from seed material obtained\nfrom the USDA-ARS Plant Germplasm Introduction and Testing\nResearch Unit (Pullman, WA, United States). Brachypodium\nseeds were imbibed for 3 days at 4\u2000C and sown in 7 \u2000 7 cm\npots filled with Sunshine Potting Mix #4 (Sun Gro Horticulture,\nAgawam, MA, United States). Plants were grown in an IR-\n89X (Percival Scientific, Perry, IA, United States) controlled\nenvironment chamber retrofitted with 6500K and 3000K T5 54W\ngrow lights (Spectralux) under a 20-h light, 24\u2000C/4-h dark, 18\u2000C\ncycle. Plants were watered and fertilized with Jack’s professional\nwater-soluble fertilizer (20:20:20) (JR Peters, Allentown, PA,\nUnited States). After 12 weeks and plant senescence, seeds\nwere collected, processed, and stored under desiccant and dark\nconditions at room temperature.\nTo collect root exudates, seeds of B. distachyon Bd21 were\nsurface-sterilized, pregerminated, and placed in sterile 1 L widemouth\nglass jars containing 113 g of 6-mm glass beads and\n25 ml distilled water. Jars were covered with vented caps\nand plants were grown hydroponically in an environmental\ncontrolled growth chamber under conditions described above.\nAfter 6 days, root exudates were extracted from individual\njars and their sterility was confirmed by spotting on nutrient\nagar. Multiple batches of root exudates were collected, filtered\n(0.22 mm), aliquoted in Falcon tubes (10 ml), lyophilized, and\nstored at –80\u2000C.\nMetabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates\nExudates were analyzed for primary metabolites at the Murdock\nMetabolomics Laboratory at Washington State University\n(Pullman, WA, United States). Freeze-dried residues were\nsuspended in 500 ml 50% aqueous acetonitrile and clarified by\ncentrifugation for 20 min at 21,000 \u2000 g and 4\u2000C. The liquid\nchromatography mass spectrometry analysis was conducted\nwith a Synapt G2-S quadrupole-ion mobility spectrometrytime\nof flight mass spectrometer system equipped with an\nacquity ultra-performance liquid chromatograph (UPLC) and\nan acquity photodiode array detector (all from Waters, Milford,\nMA, United States). The exudate metabolites were separated\non a SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC HPLC column (2.1 \u2000 100 mm,\n3 mm) (Milllipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, United States) using\nacetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid as solvent B and water\nwith 0.1% formic acid as solvent A at a flow rate of 400 ml\nmin\U001000001 and the following linear gradient extending over 14 min:\n0 min, 80% B; 4 min, 80% B, 6 min: 10% B; 7.5 min, 10%\nB; 10 min, 80% B; and 14 min, 80% B. Mass spectra were\ncollected in positive ion mode over a range of m/z 50–1,200\nwith a scan time of 0.2 s. The Q-TOF-MS source was at\n3.0 kV and 120\u2000C; the sampling cone at 40 V, desolvation\ntemperature was 250\u2000C; cone gas and desolvation gas flow were\nat 0 and 850 L h\U001000001, respectively. Leucine enkephalin was used\nfor post-acquisition mass correction. Target compounds were\nvisualized using selected ion chromatograms at 0.05 Da window\nwidth. The compound identification was based on comparison\nof chromatographic behavior and accurate masses to those of\nauthentic standards.\nFor gas chromatography, derivatization was carried out using\na modification of the procedure of Lee and Fiehn (2008).\nThe freeze-dried residues were suspended in 950 ml aqueous\nmethanol (84%, v/v) and clarified by centrifugation for 15 min\nat 21,000 \u2000 g at 4\u2000C. The supernatants were spiked with 1\nmg of the internal standard salicylic acid-d6 (C/D/N Isotopes,\nQuebec, Canada) and dried in vacuo. The dry residues were\nsuspended in 10 ml of O-methoxylamine hydrochloride (30 mg\nml\U001000001 in anhydrous pyridine, both from Millipore Sigma) and\nincubated while mixing (1,000 RPM) for 90 min at 30\u2000C.\nSubsequently, samples were derivatized with 90 ml of MSTFA\nwith 1% TMCS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,\nUnited States) for 30 min at 37\u2000C. Gas chromatography-mass\nspectroscopy analysis was performed using a Pegasus 4D timeof-\nflight mass spectrometer (LECO, Saint Joseph MI) equipped\nwith a MPS2 autosampler (Gerstel, Linthicum, MD) and a 7890A\noven (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States).\nThe derivatization products were separated on a 30-m, 0.25 mm\ni.d., 0.25 mm df Rxi-5Sil column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA,\nUnited States) with an IntegraGuard precolumn using ultrapure\nHe at a constant flow of 0.9 ml min\U001000001 as carrier gas. The linear\nthermal gradient started with a 1-min hold at 70\u2000C, followed\nby a ramp to 300\u2000C at 10\u2000C min\U001000001. The final temperature was\nheld for 5 min prior to returning to initial conditions. Mass\nspectra were collected at 17 spectra s\U001000001. Peak identification was\nconducted using the Fiehn primary metabolite library (Kind\net al., 2009) and an identity score cutoff of 700. Additionally,\nauthentic standards for a number of primary metabolites were\nanalyzed under identical conditions and the data used to compare\nthe chromatographic behavior. Peak alignment and spectrum\ncomparisons were carried out using the Statistical Compare\nfeature of ChromaTOF software (LECO).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 3 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nIsolation of RNA From Bacteria Cultured\nin Root Exudates and RNA-Seq\nThe strains were pregrown overnight at 25\u2000C on 21C-glucose\nagar and then subcultured into 96-well microplates containing\nliquid 21C-glucose medium amended with Brachypodium\nexudates. The liquid medium was prepared by dissolving the\nlyophilized root exudate material in an appropriate volume of\n21C-glucose medium to concentrate root exudates 20-fold. The\ngrowth medium was sterilized by passing it through a 0.22-\nmm membrane filter. The control cultures were grown under\nidentical conditions in the absence of exudates. All treatments\nwere inoculated at OD600 of 0.1 and incubated for 20 to\n22 h until cultures entered late-exponential growth phase at\n25\u2000C in an atmosphere of 15% oxygen [created by a ProOx\nP110 oxygen controller (BioSpherix, Parish, NY, United States)\nwith a hypoxia C-chamber]. The cells were stabilized by the\naddition RNAprotect reagent (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD,\nUnited States) and total RNA was purified using a RNeasy Protect\nBacteria Mini Kit (QIAGEN) from three biological replicates of\neach strain cultured under control conditions and in exudates.\nThe quality assessment of the extracted RNA samples was\nperformed with a NanoDrop OneC Spectrophotometer (Thermo\nFisher Scientific) and a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies)\nand revealed A260/A280 and A260/A230 values of > 2.0 and a mean\nRNA integrity numbers (RIN) value of > 9.2.\nThree biological replicates of RNA samples were shipped on\ndry ice to the DOE Joint Genome Institute (Walnut Creek, CA,\nUnited States), where rRNA was depleted and stranded RNASeq\nlibraries were prepared, quantified by qPCR and sequenced\nusing a HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina). The fastq file reads\nwere filtered and processed with BBDuk1 to remove reads that\ncontained 1 or more “N” bases, had an average quality score\nacross the read less than 10 or had a minimum length < 51 bp\nor 33% of the full read length. Reads mapped with BBMap (see\ntext footnote 2) to masked human, cat, dog, and mouse references\nat 93% identity were removed. Another category of removed\nsequences matched RNA spike-in, PhiX, common microbial\ncontaminants, and ribosomal RNAs. The processed reads from\neach library were aligned to the reference genome using BBMap\nwith only unique mappings allowed (BAMs/directory). If a\nread mapped to more than one location it was ignored.\nfeatureCounts (Liao et al., 2014) was used to generate raw\ngene counts, which were normalized to adjust for the length of\neach gene and total number of reads mapped for each library.\nThe normalization formula used: n = [r/(l/1,000)]/(t/1,000,000),\nwhere n = normalized read count for gene (G) for library (L);\nr = raw read count for gene G for library L; l = gene G length; and\nt = total reads mapped for library L. Raw gene counts were used to\nevaluate the level of correlation between biological samples using\nPearson’s correlation.\nBioinformatic Analysis\nCount tables generated by the JGI RNA-Seq pipeline were input\ninto DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) to normalize and determine\n1https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/\ndifferential expression. Statistical significance was established\nthrough DESeq2 by using three biological replicates for control\nand root exudate conditions. Scatterplots were generated from\nthe DESeq2 data table outputs using ggplot2. Genes differentially\nexpressed between control and root exudate samples (log2 foldchanges\n–2 \u2000 to \u2000 2, adjusted p value \u2000 0.05) were used in\ndownstream analysis. The core genome and pangenome for the\nPseudomonas strains used in this study were computed using the\nOthoMCL v.2.0, Species Tree Builder v.2.2.0, and Phylogenetic\nPangenome Accumulation v1.4.0 apps implemented in the U.S.\nDepartment of Energy Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase)\n(Arkin et al., 2018). Additional comparisons were conducted\nwith the PGAweb pangenome analysis pipeline (Chen et al.,\n2018). Differentially expressed genes were assigned to core,\nnon-core, and singleton parts of each strain’s proteome by\nBLASTp with an E value cutoff of e-06, identity of 40%\nand coverage of 60%. Functional annotation of differentially\nexpressed genes was carried out with the Blast2GO (Conesa\nand Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al.,\n2018). Additional manual curation was performed using tools\nimplemented in the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG)\ndatabase (Markowitz et al., 2012), Pseudomonas Genome\nDatabase (Winsor et al., 2009), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and\nGenomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa et al., 2008), and Geneious 10.2.3\n(Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand). Metabolic functions\nencoded by the differentially expressed genes were mapped\nusing iPath 3.0 (Darzi et al., 2018). Phylogenetic analyses\nwere carried out by building multiple sequence alignments\nwith MAFFT v7.222 (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and inferring\nneighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenies with Geneious Tree Builder.\nThe resultant phylogenetic trees were visualized with iTOL\n(Letunic and Bork, 2016). Reproducibility of clades within the\ninferred NJ trees was assessed by bootstrap resampling with\n1,000 replicates.\nCharacterization of Carbon Source\nUtilization With Biolog Phenotype\nMicroarrays\nThe utilization of carbon sources was analyzed using Phenotype\nMicroArrays (Biolog, Hayward, CA, United States) as follows.\nThe bacteria were cultured overnight on Luria-Bertani agar\nat 25\u2000C, after which cells were harvested and suspended in\ninoculating fluid (IF-0). The transmittance of the suspension\nwas adjusted to 42% using a Biolog turbidimeter. The cell\nsuspension was mixed with IF\U001000000 containing Dye Mix A\n(Biolog) to achieve a final transmittance of 85%. One hundred\nmicroliter aliquots of the adjusted cell suspension were\ninoculated into PM01 and PM02A plates, which were then\nincubated in an OmniLog Phenotype MicroArray System\n(Biolog) at 25\u2000C for 48 h. The formation of formazan was\nrecorded at 15 min intervals, and data were analyzed using\nOmniLog Parametric Analysis software v1.20.02 (Biolog).\nRelative growth of the studied strains was normalized to\ngrowth on D-glucose and visualized using Heatmapper\n(Babicki et al., 2016).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 4 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nData Availability\nSequences generated in this project were deposited\nunder NCBI BioProject accession numbers PRJNA439743\nthrough PRJNA439790.\nRESULTS\nMetabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates\nof B. distachyon\nMetabolomics analysis of lyophilized root exudates revealed\nthe presence of numerous plant metabolites, 86 of which were\nidentified by matching their spectra to the LECO/Fiehn\nMetabolomics library (Supplementary Table 3). These\nmetabolites included (i) carbohydrates and their derivatives\n(glucose, fructose, xylose, sucrose, trehalose, maltose, galactose,\nand others); (ii) sugar alcohols (b-mannosylglycerate, myoinositol,\ngalactinol, 2-deoxyerythritol, ribitol, threitol and\ncellobitol); (iii) amino acids and derivatives (glutamine,\ntyrosine, glutamic acid, asparagine, aspartic acid, valine,\nphenylalanine, isoleucine, glycine, serine, proline, leucine,\ntryptophan, cysteine, methionine, citrulline, and others); (iv)\norganic acids (aconitic, allantoic, g-aminobutyric, azelaic, citric,\nfumaric, 2-furoic, D-glyceric, 3-hydroxypropionic, a-ketoadipic,\nmalic, methylmalonic, nicotinic, quinic, succinic, threonic);\nand (v) assorted metabolites including heterocyclic compounds,\nphenolics, and biogenic amines, etc (3-hydroxypyridine,\nmaleimide, noradrenaline, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoate,\n5-methoxytryptamine, uracil, aminomalonic acid, palmitic acid,\nand urea). Results of the analysis also revealed that root exudates\nof B. distachyon contain hydroxyectoine and the quaternary\namine (QA) glycine betaine (Supplementary Figure 1).\nPhylogenetic and Pangenome Analyses\nof Pseudomonas Strains Used in the\nStudy\nWe used a set of phylogenetic markers suggested by Mulet et al.\n(2010) to investigate the relatedness of the eight strains used in\nthis study to distinct lineages recognized within the P. fluorescens\nspecies complex. The multilocus sequence analysis based on\nthe concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S\nrRNA), gyrB, rpoB, and rpoD identified R1-43-08 (along with\nstrains 2-79 and SBW25) as a member of the P. fluorescens\nsubgroup (Figure 1). The rest of the strains clustered closely with\nfour additional subgroups of the P. fluorescens complex, namely\nP. corrugata (strains Q2-87 and Q8r1-96), P. koreensis (Pf0-1),\nP. protegens (Pf-5), and P. chlororaphis (30–84). The genomes of\nthe eight rhizosphere Pseudomonas strains varied in size by 1.43\nmegabase (ranging from 5.65 to 7.07 Mb) and contained between\n5,166 and 6,363 protein-coding genes (Figure 2A). The shared\ngene content was characterized with OrthoMCL, which uses allagainst-\nall BLASTp followed by the Markov Cluster algorithm to\nidentify protein groups shared between the compared genomes,\nas well as groups representing species-specific gene expansion\nfamilies (Li et al., 2003). The pangenome analysis revealed a\ncore comprised of approximately 3,179 orthologs that were\nshared among all strains and represented 50.0% to 61.5%\nof each predicted proteome (Figures 2A,B). The non-core\npangenome contained genes shared by two or more (but not\nall) strains and contained between 1,482 and 2,080 orthologs,\nwhich corresponded to 28.7–36.3% of individual proteomes. The\nrest of the predicted protein-coding genes were strain-specific\nsingletons that comprised 7.5% to 15.1% of the strain’s predicted\nproteomes. In respect to divergence from the core genome, strain\nPf-5 was found to possess the highest proportion of unique genes\n(n = 949) followed by 2-79 (n = 887). The entire pangenome of\nthe Pseudomonas strains encompassed over 12,000 homolog and\nsingleton gene families.\nFurther homolog family-based comparisons identified Q8r1-\n96 and R1-43-08 as the most distantly related strains, with\n3349 shared homologs (Supplementary Table 4A). Q8r1-96 and\nQ2-87, which shared 4,489 homologs, were the most closely\nrelated strains. The partitioning of homolog gene families into\nthe core, non-core, and singleton parts of the pangenome agreed\nwith phylogenetic relationships of the strains deduced from the\nanalysis of a selected subset of COGs (Clusters of Orthologous\nGroups) (Figure 2C and Supplementary Tables 4B,C). The\nCOG-based phylogeny supported the multilocus sequence\nanalysis and revealed that the eight Pseudomonas strains form\nthree distinct clusters, the first of which contained 2-79, R1-30-\n84, and SBW25. The second cluster included Q8r1-96 and Q2-87,\nwhereas the third encompassed strains 30-84, Pf-5, and Pf0-1.\nCorrelating the Composition of Root\nExudates With Metabolic Profiles of\nPseudomonas Strains\nWe used the Phenotype MicroArray PM1 and PM2 plates to\nprofile the eight Pseudomonas strains for the utilization of\n190 different carbon sources. Results of the analysis identified\n90 compounds that supported growth and clustered by their\nintensities of utilization into three distinct groups (Figure 3).\nGroup I was comprised of 30 highly metabolized carbon\nsources, which included several amino acids and intermediates of\nglycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, and citrate cycle. Approximately\nhalf of these compounds were catabolized by all eight strains,\nand included several organic acids (fumaric, citric, gluconic,\nmalic, and pyroglutamic), amino acids (Glu, Asn, Gln, Asp, Pro,\nAla, and g-aminobutyric acid), carbohydrates (glucose, mannose,\nand mannitol), and the purine nucleoside inosine. Group II\nwas composed of 44 chemically diverse carbon sources that\nwere variably utilized by the strains. These compounds were\ncarbohydrates, organic acids, amino acids, phenolics, and polyols,\nand included known compatible solutes and intermediates of\nmetabolism of pentoses, galactose, starch, and sucrose. Group\nIII encompassed the rest of the Phenotype MicroArray test\npanel and contained compounds that were not catabolized\nby the tested strains. Among several notable exceptions were\na-hydroxyglutamic acid- g-lactone, putrescine, and itaconic,\ncitramalic, and succinamic acids, which supported the growth\nof strains 2-79, 30-84, Pf-5, and SBW25.

The phylogeny was established based on the concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S rRNA), gyrB (subunit B of DNA\ngyrase), rpoB (b subunit of RNA polymerase), and rpoD (sigma 70 factor subunit of RNA polymerase). Distance matrices were calculated by the Jukes-Cantor\nmethod. Colored circles on tree nodes indicate bootstrap values (1,000 replicates) that vary between 60% (smallest circle) and 100% (largest circles).\nB. distachyon Bd21. Interestingly, many carbon sources from\nthe Phenotype MicroArray panel were also present in the root\nexudates of B. distachyon Bd21, and some of these compounds\n(glucose, mannose, galactose, fructose, g-aminobutyric acid,\naspartic acid, citric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, quinic acid,\nalanine, glutamine, and glutamic acid) were catabolized by all\nstrains used in this study, while others (e.g., xylose, trehalose,\nm-inositol) were actively utilized only by certain organisms\n(Figure 3). The comparison of catabolic profiles across the\neight studied Pseudomonas strains revealed the presence of three\ndistinct clusters. The first cluster contained strains Q8r1-96 and\nQ2-87, which consumed very similar sets of carbon sources,\nas well as strain Pf0-1. The second cluster was composed of\n2-79, R1-43-08, SBW25, and 30-84, whereas the third cluster\nwas represented by a single strain, Pf-5. The overall similarity\nof the catabolic profiles partially agreed with the separation\nof the strains into different subgroups of the P. fluorescens\ncomplex (see above).\nAnalysis of the RNA-seq Results\nIn order to understand the cellular responses of rhizosphere\nPseudomonas to plant exometabolites, we analyzed the\ntranscriptome changes in cultures grown in the presence of\nroot exudates. Under field conditions, rhizobacteria colonize\nplant roots in the form of surface-attached microaerobic biofilms\n(Hojberg et al., 1999). To mimic these conditions, the eight\nPseudomonas strains were grown statically at 72% air saturation\nin 21C-glucose medium amended with root exudates and then\nprocessed to extract total RNA (Supplementary Figure 2).\nA total of 995 million raw sequencing reads were generated from\nthe RNA samples by using the Illumina HiSeq-2500 platform,\naveraging 20.7 million reads per sample. The removal of lowquality\nand rRNA sequences resulted in a total of 793 million\nfiltered reads that were mapped onto the eight Pseudomonas\ngenomes with a mean of 7.48 million mapped fragments per\ngenome. The differentially abundant transcripts were identified\nby setting a p value of 0.05 (adjusted for multiple testing) and\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 6 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

(B) The gradual expansion of\nthe pangenome (blue color) and contraction of the core genome (green color) following the sequential addition of genomes from the dataset. Box plots indicate the\n25th and 75th percentiles and medians (horizontal lines) with whiskers corresponding to the 10th and 90th percentiles. The input order was randomized to avoid any\nbias due to the sequential addition of new genomes. The pangenome size increases steadily without reaching a plateau even after the addition of 11,939\nnon-redundant gene families. At the same time, the core genome converged to 3,179 genes. (C) The pangenome-based phylogenomic analysis of the studied\nstrains. Here, the pangenome was defined with OrthoMCL, and orthologous gene sets were then partitioned into the core, singleton, and non-core (the remaining\northolog sets) categories. These categories were calculated for each node in the Maximum Likelihood species tree, using the set of genomes for which that node\nrepresents the ancestor. The results of the ortholog partitioning are shown in pie charts placed at tree nodes. Numbers indicate bootstrap support values. The\nanalysis was conducted in KBase (Arkin et al., 2018).\nthe log2 fold-change (FC) threshold \u2000\u2000 2.0 (Figure 4 and\nSupplementary Tables 5–12). When compared with the control\nconditions, an average of 204 genes per strain were differentially\nexpressed in the presence of root exudates, with the highest\n(n = 425) and lowest (n = 112) numbers observed, respectively,\nin SBW25 and Q2-87 (Figure 4). Overall, more genes were\ninduced than repressed in response to exudates, but the actual\nnumbers in each category varied substantially depending on the\nidentity of the Pseudomonas strain. In most strains, the bulk of\nthe differentially expressed genes was almost equally distributed\nbetween the core (mean, 48.2%) and non-core (mean, 45.8%)\nparts of the genome, whereas the strain-specific singleton genes\nconstituted on average only 5.9% (Figure 4B). One notable\nexception was observed in Q8r1-96, where all differentially\nexpressed genes belonged to the core (73.8%) and non-core\n(26.2%) parts of the genome. Another notable pattern was\nobserved in R1-43-08, where the majority of genes affected by\nthe presence of root exudate fell into the non-core category\n(56.3%). The highest proportion of differentially expressed\nsingletons (11.3 and 10.4%, respectively) was identified in\nstrains SBW25 and Pf-5.\nWe further explored how the identified differentially\nexpressed genes were distributed across genomes of the eight\nstudied rhizosphere strains. The pairwise BLASTp comparisons\nidentified 2-79 and SBW25 as two strains that shared the highest\nnumber of genes (n = 101) induced or repressed in response\nto root exudates (Table 1). The second pair of strains with\na significant number of similar differentially expressed genes\n(n = 86) was Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, which was followed by Pf0-1\nand 30-84, which shared 56 differentially expressed genes. These\npatterns of shared genes were also observed when the results of\nthe pairwise BLASTp comparisons were converted into a binary\ngene presence/absence matrix, which was then subjected to\ncluster analysis using a UPGMA algorithm based on Sorensen’s\ndissimilarity index or examined by non-metric multidimensional\nscaling (NMDS) (Figure 5).\nThe differentially expressed Pseudomonas genes were\nsubjected to Blast2Go analysis and Gene Ontology (GO)\nannotation (Figure 6). Metabolic process, catalytic activity,\nand membrane were the most common annotation terms\nacross the three primary GO term categories (i.e., biological\nprocess, molecular function, and cellular component). A total\nof 1,694 GO terms was assigned to 805 upregulated genes, with\nthe majority of the GO terms related to molecular function\n(682, 40.3%), followed by biological process (669, 39.5%), and\ncellular component (343, 20.2%). In the 539 downregulated gene\ncategory, 1,101 GO terms were assigned to biological process\n(420, 38.1%), molecular function (417, 37.9%), and cellular\ncomponent (264, 24.0%). Within biological process, metabolic\nprocess, cellular process, localization, response to stimulus, and\nregulation were over-represented. Within molecular function,\nthe largest proportion was assigned to catalytic activity, binding,\nand transporter activity categories. Within cellular component,\nthe majority were assigned to membrane, membrane part, cell,\nand cell part categories. Across the eight strains, 37–42% of\ndifferentially expressed genes had no Gene Ontology IDs and\nencoded various conserved hypothetical proteins.\nFunctional Classification of Shared\nDifferentially Expressed Genes\nThe interrogation of RNA-seq data revealed multiple cellular\npathways that were differentially regulated in bacterial cultures\nincubated with root exudates (Supplementary Figures 3, 4).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 7 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

The hierarchical clustering analysis\nwas carried out using the average linkage method with Euclidean distances.\nCarbon sources identified by red arrowheads were also detected in the sterile\nroot exudates of B. distachyon Bd21.\nAlthough none of these differentially regulated pathways were\nshared by all eight strains, the cross-strain comparisons revealed\nseveral types of common and specific transcriptomic responses\nthat were elicited by the presence of plant exometabolites\n(Table 2). The visual representation of core gene expression\npatterns is provided in Supplementary Figure 5, which\nshows heatmaps of expression profiles and p-adj values for\ncore genes shared by the studied strains. The figure is\naccompanied by Supplementary Table 13 that lists predicted\nfunctions of genes constituting the four distinct clusters\nobserved after hierarchical clustering of gene expression\nvalues. The first category of shared differentially expressed\npathways functioned in the uptake and catabolism of selected\ncarbohydrates, quaternary ammonium compounds (QAs), and\nphenolics. All strains except for R1-43-08, responded to root\nexudates by inducing the fructose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate\n(PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTSFru). The\ncomponents of this system are encoded by a conserved\noperon and include the cytoplasmic polyprotein EI/HPr/EIIAFru\n(FruB), the 1-phosphofructokinase FruK, and the fructosespecific\npermease EIIBC (FruA) (Chavarria et al., 2016). The\nPTSFru system functions by acquiring high-energy phosphates\nfrom PEP and sequentially passing them, via the EI/HPr/EIIAFru\ndomains of FruB, to the EIIB component of FruA. The\nphosphates are ultimately transferred by the EIIC transporter\nto fructose yielding fructose 1-phosphate, which is channeled\ninto the central metabolic pathways through the action of the\nphosphofructokinase FruK.\nIn all strains except for Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, the exposure to root\nexudates resulted in the induction of two genes adjacent to the\nfru cluster that encoded a Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS)\ntransporter and an L-arabinonate dehydratase (Table 2). These\ngenes are predicted to participate in the uptake and catabolism\nof L-arabinose, where L-arabinonate dehydratase plays an\nimportant role by converting L-arabinonate to 2-dehydro-3-\ndeoxy-L-arabinonate (Rahman et al., 2017). In SBW25, R1-\n43-08, and Q2-87, we also observed the induction of genes\nencoding components of the AraFGH complex, an ATP-Binding\nCassette (ABC) superfamily transporter involved in the import of\narabinose into the cell (Supplementary Tables 6, 7, 9). Finally, all\nstrains except SBW25 and R1-43-08 responded to the presence\nof exudates by upregulating a conserved gene encoding an\naldose epimerase superfamily protein. Such enzymes equilibrate\nalpha- and beta-anomers of aldoses and ensure that stereospecific\nenzymes involved in the metabolism of free sugars do not act as\nmetabolic bottlenecks (Abayakoon et al., 2018). Although some\naldose epimerases have been linked to specific pathways, the\nPseudomonas gene identified in this study could not be assigned\nto a particular metabolic process based on sequence analysis and\ngenomic location.\nSeveral Pseudomonas strains responded to the presence\nof root exudates by upregulating genes involved in the\nuptake and catabolism of myo-inositol and possibly other\nstereoisomers of inositol (Table 2). The upregulated catabolic\ngenes encode the dehydrogenase IolG, which oxidizes myoinositol\nto its corresponding ketone, as well as IolE, IolD, IolB,\nand IolC that collectively convert the 2-keto-myo-inositol to\nacetyl-CoA and the glycolysis intermediate dihydroxyacetone\nphosphate (Yoshida et al., 2008; Kohler et al., 2011). In R1-\n43-08, Q8r1-96, Q2-87, and Pf-5, the upregulated functions\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 8 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

The cross-genome comparisons revealed\nthat in all studied strains except for Pf0-1, components\nof the myo-inositol utilization pathway were encoded\nwithin a well-conserved gene cluster which, in addition to\ncatabolic and transport functions, also encodes a dedicated\ntranscriptional repressor.\nAll studied strains of Pseudomonas carry multiple genes\ninvolved in scavenging the quaternary ammonium compounds\ncholine, glycine betaine (GB), carnitine, choline-O-sulfate, and\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 9 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

Many of these genes were\ndifferentially expressed, including those encoding parts of the\nABC transporter CbcXWV, which is predicted to function in\nthe uptake of choline under water-replete conditions (Table 2).\nAmong enzymes induced in the presence of root exudates were\nthe choline dehydrogenase BetA, which converts choline to\nglycine betaine and a network of enzymes (i.e., the Rieske family\noxygenase GbcAB, the dimethyglycine demethylase DgcAB, and\nthe sarcosine oxidase SoxBDAG) that sequentially convert GB\nto glycine. In 2-79 and SBW25, this group of differentially\nregulated genes also included an AraC-family transcriptional\nactivator GbdR, which perceives intercellular levels of GB and\ninduces genes involved in the transport and catabolism of\nglycine betaine and detoxification of the catabolic byproducts\n(Hampel et al., 2014).\nThe last category of activated catabolic pathways included the\ncatechol branch of the b-ketoadipate pathway for the degradation\nof aromatic compounds. In strains 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5,\ngrowth on root exudates resulted in upregulation of catechol-\n1,2-dioxygenase, muconate cycloisomerase, and muconolactone\nisomerase, which collectively cleave the catechol ring and\nconvert it to b-ketoadipate enol-lactone (Harwood and Parales,\n1996). Finally, analysis of the P. synxantha 2-79 transcriptome\nidentified an induction of benABC genes encoding subunits\nof benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase, an oxidoreductase that generates\ncatechol from benzoate.\nIn addition to various catabolic pathways, the exposure to root\nexudates also induced several genes involved in the homeostasis\nof copper (Table 2). Four of these genes form a conserved cluster\nin genomes of the strains and encode the periplasmic coppersensing\ntwo-component system CinRS, the plastocyanin/azurinlike\nprotein CinA, and the NADPH-dependent pre-Q0 reductase\nCinQ. Also, in strains Q2-87, 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, we observed\nupregulation of a conserved operon encoding the multicopper\noxidase CopA, the periplasmic copper-binding protein CopC, the\ninner membrane protein CopD, and outer membrane protein\nCopB. In several Gram-negative bacteria, these Cop proteins are\nthought to have dual functions and participate both in the uptake\nof essential copper as well as in the sequestration of excess copper\nin the periplasm and outer membrane.\nThe analysis of shared downregulated pathways revealed that\nmost of the strains respond to the presence of root exudates by\nrepressing genes involved in the uptake and catabolism of sulfur\ncompounds (Table 2). In strains SBW25, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96,\nQ2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, this response involved the ssuEADCB\noperon responsible for the utilization of alkanesulfonates\nas sulfur sources. The ssu operon is highly conserved in\nfluorescent pseudomonads and encodes the FMNH2-dependent\nmonooxygenase SsuD and the NAD (P)H-dependent FMN\nreductase SsuE, which together catalyze the desulfonation of\nalkanesulfonates. Also, the ssu locus contains genes for the\nmolybdopterin-binding protein SsuF and the alkanesulfonatespecific\nABC-type transporter consisting of the sulfonate\nsubstrate-binding protein SsuA, sulfonate permease protein\nSsuC, and sulfonate transport ATP-binding protein SsuB. Finally,\nin R1-43-08, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, growth on root exudates\ncoincided with repression of the tauABCD operon, which\nallows these strains to utilize taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonate)\nas a sulfur source. The repressed tau genes encoded the\n2-oxoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenase TauD and\nsubstrate-binding, ATP-binding, and permease components of\nthe taurine-specific ABC transporter TauABC.\nOther Differentially Expressed Pathways\nIn addition to their effect on several shared cellular pathways,\ngrowth on root exudates resulted in the induction or repression of\nnumerous strain-specific genes. In closely related P. synxantha 2-\n79 and P. fluorescens SBW25, we observed differential expression\nof genes involved in energy metabolism, transport of amino\nacids, and surface attachment (Supplementary Tables 5, 6).\nOther notable differentially expressed pathways included 2–\n79 gene clusters that encode enzymes for the catabolism of\ntrehalose, a prophage, and toxin/antitoxin system, as well as the\nSBW25 operon predicted to control the synthesis of the capsular\nexopolysaccharide colonic acid. The response of Pseudomonas sp.\nR1-43-08 to root exudates also involved differential expression\nof different energy metabolism pathways. In addition, we\nobserved the upregulation of genes involved in the uptake and\ncatabolism of xylose (also upregulated in 2–79) and repression\nof enzymes for the biosynthesis of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid\nand assimilation of inorganic sulfur and L-cysteine biosynthesis\n(Supplementary Table 7).\nThe analysis of the Q8r1-96 transcriptome revealed\nperturbation of different metabolic pathways including genes\nencoding components of cytochrome C oxidase, transport\nand catabolism of sorbitol/mannitol, metabolism of butanoic\nacid, and biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides alginate and\npoly-b-1-6-N-acetylglucosamine (Supplementary Table 8). In\nP. fluorescens Q2-87, we identified differential expression of\ngenes involved in metabolism of galactose, tryptophan, tyrosine,\nglycine, serine, and threonine (Supplementary Table 9),\nwhile in P. chlororaphis 30-84, growth on exudates activated\nthe biosynthesis of molybdopterin cofactor, catabolism of\ngalactonate and acetoin, and uptake and catabolism of putrescine\n(Supplementary Table 10).

The terms were derived from 93 different functional groups (GO subcategories level 4). The GO terms were assigned with Blast2GO (Conesa\nand Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al., 2018). On a WEGO histogram, the percentage of 100 is defined as the total number of genes assigned a GO\nterm. However, the subcategories do not add up to 100% because many genes fall into more than one functional class and are therefore annotated by multiple GO\nterms.\nwell as pathways for the utilization of glycolate and putrescine\n(Supplementary Table 11). Also induced were genes for\nthe production of pyrrolnitrin and PhlG hydrolase, which\nmodulate the metabolic loads attributed to the synthesis of\n2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol. The differentially expressed genes of\nP. fluorescens Pf0-1 included, among others, operons encoding\ncytochrome C oxidase and enzymes for catabolism of malonic\nacid (Supplementary Table 12). Yet another interesting\nfinding involved the induction of assorted genes acting in the\nhomeostasis of iron and defense against reactive oxygen species\n(ROS). We observed activation of iron dicitrate transporters\n(SBW25 and 30-84), genes for the biosynthesis of siderophores\nornicorrugatin (SBW25) and pyochelin (Pf-5), heme-degrading\nenzymes (2–79, 30–84), TonB siderophore receptors, and\ncomponents of the energy-transducing inner membrane\ncomplex TonB-ExbB-ExbD (2–79 and Pf-5).

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nsoil microorganisms. Our results were in agreement with a\nrecent report of 27 different sugars, amino acids, and organic\nacids in Brachypodium exudates (Kawasaki et al., 2016). We\nconfirmed the presence of exometabolites identified in that\nstudy, along with dozens of additional analytes that were\nidentified by matching their mass-spectra and retention indices\nto the LECO/Fiehn Metabolomics library (Supplementary\nTable 3). The complementation of the metabolomic analysis\nwith profiling of the bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays\nrevealed that a substantial proportion of the characterized\nexudate constituents were catabolized by a collection of eight\nPseudomonas strains from across the P. fluorescens group that is\nknown to form associations with plant roots. The amendment\nof Pseudomonas cultures with root exudates caused changes in\nthe expression of multiple genes encoding catabolic and anabolic\nenzymes, predicted transporters, transcriptional regulators, stress\nresponse, and conserved hypothetical proteins. In most strains,\nthese differentially expressed genes were almost equally split\nbetween the core and variable genome regions, mirroring\nthe substantial strain-to-strain variation in the genome size\nand gene content within the P. fluorescens species complex\n(Loper et al., 2012).\nThe analysis of transcriptome responses to root exudates\nrevealed several types of cellular pathways present in the strains\nused in this study. The first category of such pathways was\ninvolved in the catabolism of carbohydrates such as fructose,\narabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, trehalose, and galactose. Among\nthese catabolic traits, the ability to utilize fructose as a carbon\nsource is highly conserved among fluorescent pseudomonads.\nIn contrast, growth on arabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, and\ntrehalose is variably present and was traditionally used to\ndifferentiate species and biovars within the P. fluorescens\ngroup (Barrett et al., 1986). We speculate that such variably\ndistributed pathways contribute to the differential affinity of\npseudomonads toward host plants and/or to determine which\nstrains flourish in response to growing roots and changing\nenvironments. Several independent studies have confirmed\nthe importance of carbohydrate catabolism pathways for the\nbiology of rhizosphere pseudomonads. For example, in vivo\nexpression technology (IVET) profiling of P. fluorescens SBW25\nidentified xylose isomerase among genome regions essential\nfor the colonization of sugar beet seedlings (Liu et al., 2015),\nwhereas a genome-wide Tn-Seq screen of Pseudomonas simiae\nidentified genes for the catabolism of myo-inositol among traits\nessential for the colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana roots\n(Cole et al., 2017).\nThe response of rhizosphere Pseudomonas to Brachypodium\nroot exudates also involved pathways for the uptake and\nmetabolism of amino acids. We observed differential\nexpression of genes encoding the hydrophobic (HAAT) and\npolar (PAAT) amino acid uptake transporters in strains\n2-79, SBW25, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5. Other related genes\nencoded enzymes for the catabolism of valine and glutamic\nacid (2-79); metabolism of tryptophan, glycine, serine, and\nthreonine (Q2-87); and biosynthesis of methionine (Q8r1-\n96). It is plausible that the abundance of amino acids in\nroot exudates is also linked to the repression of pathways\ninvolved in the catabolism of sulfonates and taurine that\nwas observed in several strains (Table 2). Although the\npreferred source of sulfur for P. fluorescens is unknown, in the\nclosely related P. aeruginosa, the sulfur starvation response\nis triggered by the growth on any sulfur compound other\nthan sulfate, thiocyanate, and cysteine (Hummerjohann et al.,\n1998). This fact, together with the presence of cysteine and\ncystine in the root exudates, suggest that root exudates of\nBrachypodium may serve as an important source of sulfur for\nrhizosphere Pseudomonas. These findings also agree well with\nthe reported scarcity of inorganic sulfate in the soil, and the\npresence of sulfur mostly in the form of organic compounds,\nincluding amino acids, proteins, sulfate esters, and sulfonates\n(Autry and Fitzgerald, 1990).\nAnother interesting result of this study was the concerted\nactivation of copper and iron homeostasis pathways observed\nin all of the Pseudomonas strains used in this work. In bacteria,\nan excess of copper is toxic and triggers oxidative stress due to\nthe formation of free radicals, as well as disruption of protein\nmetalation and stability of iron-sulfur clusters (Bondarczuk\nand Piotrowska-Seget, 2013). On the other hand, copper is an\nessential trace element used as a cofactor in different enzymes.\nSimilarly, although elevated levels of iron cause redox stress, this\nelement is also found in active energy metabolism enzymes and is\ncrucial for bacterial growth (Andrews et al., 2003). The analysis\nof metal homeostasis genes identified in this study suggests\nthat their induction was likely triggered by the deficiency of\ncopper and iron in bacterial cultures grown in the presence of\nroot exudates. We attribute this effect to the ability of some\ncomponents of root exudates to chelate soil metals.\nDespite the abundance of iron in the soil, its bioavailability\nis limited due to the low solubility of Fe (III) oxyhydrates\nat neutral pH. The non-graminaceous plants circumvent this\nproblem by acidifying the rhizosphere and secreting flavins,\nphenolics, and organic acids that chelate iron. The reduction\nof these ferric chelates releases soluble ferrous iron taken up\nby root cells (Kobayashi and Nishizawa, 2012). Graminaceous\nplants, like Brachypodium, acquire iron by secreting into the\nsoil non-protein amino acids of the mugineic acid (MA) group,\nwhich act as Fe (III)-chelating phytosiderophores. In addition to\niron, low-molecular-weight organic acids and phytosiderophores\nbind other divalent and trivalent metals (including copper) and\ncontribute to heavy-metal tolerance in plants (Chen et al., 2017).\nIt is plausible that the presence of these plant exometabolites\nis responsible for the deficit of iron and copper observed in\nPseudomonas cultures grown in the presence of root exudates.\nThese results further underscore the importance of diverse and\nredundant metal homeostasis pathways found in genomes of the\nP. fluorescens group for the ability of these organisms to colonize\nand persist in the plant rhizosphere.\nRecently, Klonowska et al. (2018) examined transcriptomic\nresponses of symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria to root\nexudates of the legume plant Mimosa pundica, which has\nan unusual ability to support both alpha- (Rhizobium) and\nbeta-rhizobia (Cupriavidus and Burkholderia). Using RNA-seq,\nthe authors characterized genes involved in the perception of\nroot exudates in the nodulating bacteria Burkholderia phymatum\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 14 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nSTM815, Cupriavidus taiwanensis LMG19424, and Rhizobium\nmesoamericanum STM3625. Interestingly, the analysis of\ndifferentially expressed genes revealed induction of pathways\ninvolved in the catabolism of fructose, xylose, myo-inositol,\nand protocatechuate/catechol. Also upregulated were some\ncopper homeostasis, siderophore biosynthesis, and oxidative\nstress genes. Finally, the analytical profiling of M. pundica\nexudates revealed an overlap with Brachypodium in the types of\ncarbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids present. These\nfindings suggest that differentially expressed genes shared by\nmultiple strains of the group P. fluorescens are not unique to\nthe Brachypodium-Pseudomonas system but represent a set\nof conserved cellular pathways involved in the perception of\nplant exometabolites by different clades of rhizosphere-dwelling\nProteobacteria.\nMost strains included in this study were originally selected\nbased on the ability to colonize the rhizosphere and produce\nsecondary metabolites that alleviate the plant stress response\nand/or inhibit soilborne pathogens. It has been suggested\nthat plant metabolites released into the rhizosphere affect\nthe biocontrol activity of plant-beneficial pseudomonads (de\nWerra et al., 2011). We provide further support to this\nhypothesis by demonstrating that in some strains, root exudates\nmodulate the expression of genes for the catabolism of\nthe plant growth-promoting metabolites acetoin and 2,3-\nbutanediol. The exposure to exudates also affected the expression\nof genes for the synthesis of well-characterized antifungal\ncompounds pyrrolnitrin, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, and 2,4-\ndiacetylphloroglucinol. The modulatory effects were strainspecific,\nsuggesting significant differences in the regulatory\nnetworks involved in the perception of plant signals and\nregulation of the production of antibiotics and growthpromoting\nmetabolites.\nThe final significant finding of this study was the induction\nof catabolism of quaternary amines (QAs) observed in multiple\nstrains of the P. fluorescens group during growth on root\nexudates. This observation was supported by the detection of\nglycine betaine in the root secretions of B. distachyon. The\npresence of QAs in plant tissues and the capacity of these\nmetabolites to provide stress protection and nutrients to plant\npathogens and symbionts were reported before (Boncompagni\net al., 1999; Chen et al., 2013; Kabbadj et al., 2017), but our\nstudy is among the first to highlight the potential importance of\nthese metabolites for rhizosphere interactions. Pseudomonads do\nnot synthesize QAs de novo but have evolved many pathways to\nscavenge them from eukaryotic hosts, where these metabolites\nare abundant due to the prominence of phosphatidylcholine\nin cellular membranes. Strains of P. fluorescens carry genes\nfor the conversion of choline, carnitine, and glycine betaine to\nglycine, as well as quaternary amine transporters of the BCCT\nand ABC families that are also conserved in the opportunistic\nhuman pathogen P. aeruginosa and the plant pathogen P. syringae\n(Galvao et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2013; Wargo, 2013b).\nIn P. aeruginosa, choline catabolism genes are essential for\nthe ability of this pathogen to persist during lung infection\n(Wargo, 2013a). Similarly, a P. syringae mutant deficient in\nBetT, OpuC, and CbcXWV quaternary amine transporters had\nreduced fitness during colonization of bean and soybean leaves\nunder greenhouse and field conditions (Chen et al., 2013).\nDepending on water availability, P. aeruginosa and P. syringae\ncatabolize exogenously supplied QAs as carbon and nitrogen\nsources or accumulate them as osmoprotectants (Chen et al.,\n2013; Wargo, 2013b). Our ongoing work in P. synxantha 2–\n79 unraveled similar physiological responses and demonstrated\nthat QA transporters function differentially and redundantly\nin the uptake of quaternary amines as nutrients (Pablo and\nMavrodi, unpublished). In contrast, under water stress, the QAs\ncholine, betaine, and carnitine are accumulated preferentially for\nosmoprotection. Under drought stress, a 2–79 mutant devoid\nof all known QA transporters was less competitive in the\ncolonization of the Brachypodium rhizosphere than its wild-type\nparental strain. Interestingly, our metabolomic profiling of root\nexudates also revealed proline, glutamine, and hydroxyectoine.\nThese metabolites act as compatible solutes in different groups\nof microorganisms (Yancey et al., 1982; Empadinhas and da\nCosta, 2008), suggesting an important role of root exudates\nin the ability of Pseudomonas to persist in the rhizosphere of\ndrought-stressed plants.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe original contributions presented in the study are publicly\navailable.

Plant roots secrete carbon-rich rhizodeposits containing primary and\nsecondary low molecular weight metabolites, lysates, and mucilages. These exudates\nprovide nutrients for soil microorganisms and modulate their affinity to host plants, but\nmolecular details of this process are largely unresolved. We addressed this gap by\nfocusing on the molecular dialog between eight well-characterized beneficial strains\nof the Pseudomonas fluorescens group and Brachypodium distachyon, a model for\neconomically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops of the grass family. We\ncollected and analyzed root exudates of B. distachyon and demonstrated the presence\nof multiple carbohydrates, amino acids, organic acids, and phenolic compounds. The\nsubsequent screening of bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays revealed that many\nof these metabolites provide carbon and energy for the Pseudomonas strains. RNAseq\nprofiling of bacterial cultures amended with root exudates revealed changes in the\nexpression of genes encoding numerous catabolic and anabolic enzymes, transporters,\ntranscriptional regulators, stress response, and conserved hypothetical proteins. Almost\nhalf of the differentially expressed genes mapped to the variable part of the strains’\npangenome, reflecting the importance of the variable gene content in the adaptation of\nP. fluorescens to the rhizosphere lifestyle. Our results collectively reveal the diversity\nof cellular pathways and physiological responses underlying the establishment of\nmutualistic interactions between these beneficial rhizobacteria and their plant hosts.\nKeywords: Pseudomonas, Brachypodium, rhizosphere, root exudates, transcriptome\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 1 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nINTRODUCTION\nPlants are meta-organisms or holobionts that rely in part on\ntheir microbiome for specific functions and traits. The ability\nof the plant microbiome to influence plant development, vigor,\nhealth, and fitness in response to abiotic stressors associated\nwith global climate change is documented by numerous studies\n(Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009). There is mounting evidence\nthat plants actively recruit beneficial microbiomes, but many\naspects of this process are still very much a black box (Reinhold-\nHurek et al., 2015). The foundation for the differential affinity\nof rhizobacteria toward host plants is built upon complex\nchemical cross talk between microorganisms and plant roots.\nUp to 40% of photosynthetically fixed carbon is released by\nplant roots in the form of exudates and secretions, lysates, and\nmucilages (Curl and Truelove, 1986; Lynch, 1990; Whipps, 1990;\nBadri and Vivanco, 2009). The release of these compounds is\nactively controlled in response to environmental stimuli, and the\ncomposition of root exudates varies greatly according to plant\nspecies and physiological condition (Lynch, 1990; Nguyen, 2003;\nPhillips et al., 2004; De-la-Pena et al., 2008). The presence and\ncomposition of exudates strongly impact soil microorganisms,\nwhich is consistent with the idea that plants actively select and\nshape their root microbiota (Zolla et al., 2013).\nPrimary root exudates include simple and complex sugars,\namino acids, polypeptides and proteins, organic, aliphatic and\nfatty acids, sterols, and phenolics (Nguyen, 2003; Badri and\nVivanco, 2009; Badri et al., 2009). These compounds serve as\ncarbon and energy sources for rhizobacteria, and the presence\nof the intact corresponding catabolic pathways is essential\nfor competitive colonization of roots and disease suppression\n(Lugtenberg et al., 2001; Kamilova et al., 2005; Lugtenberg and\nKamilova, 2009). Root exudates also contain numerous signal\nmolecules and secondary metabolites, the significance of which\nis only now emerging (Walker et al., 2003; Bais et al., 2005,\n2006). A handful of analyses of plant-induced gene expression\nby transcriptional profiling in vitro (Mark et al., 2005) or in\nthe rhizosphere (Silby and Levy, 2004; Ramos-Gonzalez et al.,\n2005; Matilla et al., 2007; Barret et al., 2009) have identified\nmultiple genes that are differentially regulated by exposure to\nroots or root exudates. Bacterial pathways expressed during\nrhizosphere colonization control utilization of plant-derived\nmetabolites (Simons et al., 1996, 1997; Camacho-Carvajal, 2001;\nLugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), motility and chemotaxis (de\nWeert et al., 2002; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), phase\nvariation (Dekkers et al., 1998; Sanchez-Contreras et al., 2002;\nvan den Broek et al., 2005), outer membrane integrity (de Weert\net al., 2006; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), and the ability\nto sequester limiting resources (Raaijmakers et al., 1995) and\nresist environmental stresses (Sarniguet et al., 1995; Miller and\nWood, 1996; van Veen et al., 1997; Schnider-Keel et al., 2001). In\nits spatial and temporal properties, root colonization resembles\nbiofilm formation, and biofilm-related pathways also have been\nimplicated in adhesion to seeds and roots and rhizosphere\ncolonization (Espinosa-Urgel et al., 2000; Hinsa et al., 2003;\nYousef-Coronado et al., 2008; Fuqua, 2010; Martinez-Gil et al.,\n2010; Nielsen et al., 2011; Zboralski and Filion, 2020). Finally,\nroot exudates strongly affect the expression of diverse plant\ngrowth promotion and biocontrol genes (Vacheron et al., 2013).\nOver the past decade, the genomes of numerous rhizosphere\nstrains have been sequenced and analyzed, but functional\ngenomics studies of rhizosphere competence lag behind the\navailability of sequence data.\nThis study explored the molecular dialog between the\nmodel host plant Brachypodium distachyon and several wellcharacterized\nrhizosphere strains of the Pseudomonas fluorescens\ngroup. Brachypodium is a small annual grass originating in semiarid\nregions of the Middle East that has emerged as a prime model\nfor economically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops\nof the grass family (Bevan et al., 2010; Schwartz et al., 2010;\nBrkljacic et al., 2011; Hong et al., 2011; Tyler et al., 2014). The\nbiology, extensive collection of resources, and research tools\nmake B. distachyon an attractive model to investigate interactions\nbetween plants and root-associated microbes. Pseudomonads\nare ubiquitous Gram-negative g-proteobacteria that colonize\neukaryotic hosts and include both commensals and economically\nimportant pathogens of plants and animals (Moore et al.,\n2006; Schroth et al., 2006; Yahr and Parsek, 2006). The genus\nPseudomonas currently comprises > 100 named species that have\nbeen separated based on multilocus sequence analysis into 14\nspecies groups (Garrido-Sanz et al., 2016; Hesse et al., 2018).\nThe P. fluorescens group is the most diverse regarding both\nthe genetic distances within it, the number of species and the\nlarge pangenome that makes up > 50% of the pangenome\nof the genus as a whole (Loper et al., 2012). The group also\nencompasses an unusually high proportion of strains that inhabit\nthe plant rhizosphere and possess plant growth promoting and\nbiocontrol properties. Naylor et al. (2017) profiled bacterial\ncommunities associated with root tissues and rhizosphere of\n18 different plant species of the Poaceae family. That study\nidentified Pseudomonas among taxa constituting the core grass\nroot microbiome and demonstrated that these bacteria were\nenriched in C3 plants, including wheat, rye, barley, oat, and\nBrachypodium. We confirmed the capacity of B. distachyon\nBd21 to serve as a host for rhizobacteria of the P. fluorescens\ngroup in preliminary greenhouse assays with biocontrol strains\nP. synxantha 2-79, P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96, and P. protegens\nPf-5. Results of these experiments revealed that all strains\nsuccessfully established and colonized the roots of Brachypodium\n(Supplementary Table 1).\nIn this study, we focused on eight well-studied strains\nof the P. fluorescens complex that are supported by years\nof studies, numerous refereed publications, and high-quality\ngenome sequences. By profiling transcriptomes of these strains\nduring growth in root exudates of B. distachyon, we revealed the\ndiversity of cellular pathways and physiological responses that\nunderlie the establishment of mutualistic interactions between\nbeneficial rhizobacteria and the host plant. Our results also\nconfirmed that root exudates contain carbohydrates, amino acids,\norganic acids, and phenolics that serve as carbon and energy\nsources for rhizobacteria. The root exudates also contained\nosmoprotectants that may help microorganisms to persist in the\nrhizosphere of drought-stressed plants.

R1-43-08 (Parejko\net al., 2012), P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96 (Raaijmakers and Weller,\n1998), P. fluorescens Q2-87 (Bangera and Thomashow, 1996),\nP. chlororaphis 30-84 (Thomashow et al., 1990), P. fluorescens\nPf0-1 (Silby et al., 2009), and P. protegens Pf-5 (Howell and\nStipanovic, 1980). The selected organisms have been studied\nextensively for their role in biological control and plant\ngrowth promotion (Supplementary Table 2). The strains were\nmaintained in the laboratory as frozen stocks (\U0010000080\u2000C) and\nroutinely cultured in King’s medium B (King et al., 1954) or\n21C medium, which contained (per 1 L): 1.0 g of NH4Cl, 3.5 g\nof Na2HPO4\u20002H2O, 2.8 g of KH2PO4, 3.0 g of glucose, and\n20 ml of a microelement solution (Smibert and Kreig, 1994;\nHalverson and Firestone, 2000).\nPropagation of Plants and Collection of\nRoot Exudates\nB. distachyon Bd21 was established from seed material obtained\nfrom the USDA-ARS Plant Germplasm Introduction and Testing\nResearch Unit (Pullman, WA, United States). Brachypodium\nseeds were imbibed for 3 days at 4\u2000C and sown in 7 \u2000 7 cm\npots filled with Sunshine Potting Mix #4 (Sun Gro Horticulture,\nAgawam, MA, United States). Plants were grown in an IR-\n89X (Percival Scientific, Perry, IA, United States) controlled\nenvironment chamber retrofitted with 6500K and 3000K T5 54W\ngrow lights (Spectralux) under a 20-h light, 24\u2000C/4-h dark, 18\u2000C\ncycle. Plants were watered and fertilized with Jack’s professional\nwater-soluble fertilizer (20:20:20) (JR Peters, Allentown, PA,\nUnited States). After 12 weeks and plant senescence, seeds\nwere collected, processed, and stored under desiccant and dark\nconditions at room temperature.\nTo collect root exudates, seeds of B. distachyon Bd21 were\nsurface-sterilized, pregerminated, and placed in sterile 1 L widemouth\nglass jars containing 113 g of 6-mm glass beads and\n25 ml distilled water. Jars were covered with vented caps\nand plants were grown hydroponically in an environmental\ncontrolled growth chamber under conditions described above.\nAfter 6 days, root exudates were extracted from individual\njars and their sterility was confirmed by spotting on nutrient\nagar. Multiple batches of root exudates were collected, filtered\n(0.22 mm), aliquoted in Falcon tubes (10 ml), lyophilized, and\nstored at –80\u2000C.\nMetabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates\nExudates were analyzed for primary metabolites at the Murdock\nMetabolomics Laboratory at Washington State University\n(Pullman, WA, United States). Freeze-dried residues were\nsuspended in 500 ml 50% aqueous acetonitrile and clarified by\ncentrifugation for 20 min at 21,000 \u2000 g and 4\u2000C. The liquid\nchromatography mass spectrometry analysis was conducted\nwith a Synapt G2-S quadrupole-ion mobility spectrometrytime\nof flight mass spectrometer system equipped with an\nacquity ultra-performance liquid chromatograph (UPLC) and\nan acquity photodiode array detector (all from Waters, Milford,\nMA, United States). The exudate metabolites were separated\non a SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC HPLC column (2.1 \u2000 100 mm,\n3 mm) (Milllipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, United States) using\nacetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid as solvent B and water\nwith 0.1% formic acid as solvent A at a flow rate of 400 ml\nmin\U001000001 and the following linear gradient extending over 14 min:\n0 min, 80% B; 4 min, 80% B, 6 min: 10% B; 7.5 min, 10%\nB; 10 min, 80% B; and 14 min, 80% B. Mass spectra were\ncollected in positive ion mode over a range of m/z 50–1,200\nwith a scan time of 0.2 s. The Q-TOF-MS source was at\n3.0 kV and 120\u2000C; the sampling cone at 40 V, desolvation\ntemperature was 250\u2000C; cone gas and desolvation gas flow were\nat 0 and 850 L h\U001000001, respectively. Leucine enkephalin was used\nfor post-acquisition mass correction. Target compounds were\nvisualized using selected ion chromatograms at 0.05 Da window\nwidth. The compound identification was based on comparison\nof chromatographic behavior and accurate masses to those of\nauthentic standards.\nFor gas chromatography, derivatization was carried out using\na modification of the procedure of Lee and Fiehn (2008).\nThe freeze-dried residues were suspended in 950 ml aqueous\nmethanol (84%, v/v) and clarified by centrifugation for 15 min\nat 21,000 \u2000 g at 4\u2000C. The supernatants were spiked with 1\nmg of the internal standard salicylic acid-d6 (C/D/N Isotopes,\nQuebec, Canada) and dried in vacuo. The dry residues were\nsuspended in 10 ml of O-methoxylamine hydrochloride (30 mg\nml\U001000001 in anhydrous pyridine, both from Millipore Sigma) and\nincubated while mixing (1,000 RPM) for 90 min at 30\u2000C.\nSubsequently, samples were derivatized with 90 ml of MSTFA\nwith 1% TMCS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,\nUnited States) for 30 min at 37\u2000C. Gas chromatography-mass\nspectroscopy analysis was performed using a Pegasus 4D timeof-\nflight mass spectrometer (LECO, Saint Joseph MI) equipped\nwith a MPS2 autosampler (Gerstel, Linthicum, MD) and a 7890A\noven (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States).\nThe derivatization products were separated on a 30-m, 0.25 mm\ni.d., 0.25 mm df Rxi-5Sil column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA,\nUnited States) with an IntegraGuard precolumn using ultrapure\nHe at a constant flow of 0.9 ml min\U001000001 as carrier gas. The linear\nthermal gradient started with a 1-min hold at 70\u2000C, followed\nby a ramp to 300\u2000C at 10\u2000C min\U001000001. The final temperature was\nheld for 5 min prior to returning to initial conditions. Mass\nspectra were collected at 17 spectra s\U001000001. Peak identification was\nconducted using the Fiehn primary metabolite library (Kind\net al., 2009) and an identity score cutoff of 700. Additionally,\nauthentic standards for a number of primary metabolites were\nanalyzed under identical conditions and the data used to compare\nthe chromatographic behavior. Peak alignment and spectrum\ncomparisons were carried out using the Statistical Compare\nfeature of ChromaTOF software (LECO).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 3 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nIsolation of RNA From Bacteria Cultured\nin Root Exudates and RNA-Seq\nThe strains were pregrown overnight at 25\u2000C on 21C-glucose\nagar and then subcultured into 96-well microplates containing\nliquid 21C-glucose medium amended with Brachypodium\nexudates. The liquid medium was prepared by dissolving the\nlyophilized root exudate material in an appropriate volume of\n21C-glucose medium to concentrate root exudates 20-fold. The\ngrowth medium was sterilized by passing it through a 0.22-\nmm membrane filter. The control cultures were grown under\nidentical conditions in the absence of exudates. All treatments\nwere inoculated at OD600 of 0.1 and incubated for 20 to\n22 h until cultures entered late-exponential growth phase at\n25\u2000C in an atmosphere of 15% oxygen [created by a ProOx\nP110 oxygen controller (BioSpherix, Parish, NY, United States)\nwith a hypoxia C-chamber]. The cells were stabilized by the\naddition RNAprotect reagent (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD,\nUnited States) and total RNA was purified using a RNeasy Protect\nBacteria Mini Kit (QIAGEN) from three biological replicates of\neach strain cultured under control conditions and in exudates.\nThe quality assessment of the extracted RNA samples was\nperformed with a NanoDrop OneC Spectrophotometer (Thermo\nFisher Scientific) and a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies)\nand revealed A260/A280 and A260/A230 values of > 2.0 and a mean\nRNA integrity numbers (RIN) value of > 9.2.\nThree biological replicates of RNA samples were shipped on\ndry ice to the DOE Joint Genome Institute (Walnut Creek, CA,\nUnited States), where rRNA was depleted and stranded RNASeq\nlibraries were prepared, quantified by qPCR and sequenced\nusing a HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina). The fastq file reads\nwere filtered and processed with BBDuk1 to remove reads that\ncontained 1 or more “N” bases, had an average quality score\nacross the read less than 10 or had a minimum length < 51 bp\nor 33% of the full read length. Reads mapped with BBMap (see\ntext footnote 2) to masked human, cat, dog, and mouse references\nat 93% identity were removed. Another category of removed\nsequences matched RNA spike-in, PhiX, common microbial\ncontaminants, and ribosomal RNAs. The processed reads from\neach library were aligned to the reference genome using BBMap\nwith only unique mappings allowed (BAMs/directory). If a\nread mapped to more than one location it was ignored.\nfeatureCounts (Liao et al., 2014) was used to generate raw\ngene counts, which were normalized to adjust for the length of\neach gene and total number of reads mapped for each library.\nThe normalization formula used: n = [r/(l/1,000)]/(t/1,000,000),\nwhere n = normalized read count for gene (G) for library (L);\nr = raw read count for gene G for library L; l = gene G length; and\nt = total reads mapped for library L. Raw gene counts were used to\nevaluate the level of correlation between biological samples using\nPearson’s correlation.\nBioinformatic Analysis\nCount tables generated by the JGI RNA-Seq pipeline were input\ninto DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) to normalize and determine\n1https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/\ndifferential expression. Statistical significance was established\nthrough DESeq2 by using three biological replicates for control\nand root exudate conditions. Scatterplots were generated from\nthe DESeq2 data table outputs using ggplot2. Genes differentially\nexpressed between control and root exudate samples (log2 foldchanges\n–2 \u2000 to \u2000 2, adjusted p value \u2000 0.05) were used in\ndownstream analysis. The core genome and pangenome for the\nPseudomonas strains used in this study were computed using the\nOthoMCL v.2.0, Species Tree Builder v.2.2.0, and Phylogenetic\nPangenome Accumulation v1.4.0 apps implemented in the U.S.\nDepartment of Energy Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase)\n(Arkin et al., 2018). Additional comparisons were conducted\nwith the PGAweb pangenome analysis pipeline (Chen et al.,\n2018). Differentially expressed genes were assigned to core,\nnon-core, and singleton parts of each strain’s proteome by\nBLASTp with an E value cutoff of e-06, identity of 40%\nand coverage of 60%. Functional annotation of differentially\nexpressed genes was carried out with the Blast2GO (Conesa\nand Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al.,\n2018). Additional manual curation was performed using tools\nimplemented in the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG)\ndatabase (Markowitz et al., 2012), Pseudomonas Genome\nDatabase (Winsor et al., 2009), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and\nGenomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa et al., 2008), and Geneious 10.2.3\n(Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand). Metabolic functions\nencoded by the differentially expressed genes were mapped\nusing iPath 3.0 (Darzi et al., 2018). Phylogenetic analyses\nwere carried out by building multiple sequence alignments\nwith MAFFT v7.222 (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and inferring\nneighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenies with Geneious Tree Builder.\nThe resultant phylogenetic trees were visualized with iTOL\n(Letunic and Bork, 2016). Reproducibility of clades within the\ninferred NJ trees was assessed by bootstrap resampling with\n1,000 replicates.\nCharacterization of Carbon Source\nUtilization With Biolog Phenotype\nMicroarrays\nThe utilization of carbon sources was analyzed using Phenotype\nMicroArrays (Biolog, Hayward, CA, United States) as follows.\nThe bacteria were cultured overnight on Luria-Bertani agar\nat 25\u2000C, after which cells were harvested and suspended in\ninoculating fluid (IF-0). The transmittance of the suspension\nwas adjusted to 42% using a Biolog turbidimeter. The cell\nsuspension was mixed with IF\U001000000 containing Dye Mix A\n(Biolog) to achieve a final transmittance of 85%. One hundred\nmicroliter aliquots of the adjusted cell suspension were\ninoculated into PM01 and PM02A plates, which were then\nincubated in an OmniLog Phenotype MicroArray System\n(Biolog) at 25\u2000C for 48 h. The formation of formazan was\nrecorded at 15 min intervals, and data were analyzed using\nOmniLog Parametric Analysis software v1.20.02 (Biolog).\nRelative growth of the studied strains was normalized to\ngrowth on D-glucose and visualized using Heatmapper\n(Babicki et al., 2016).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 4 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nData Availability\nSequences generated in this project were deposited\nunder NCBI BioProject accession numbers PRJNA439743\nthrough PRJNA439790.\nRESULTS\nMetabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates\nof B. distachyon\nMetabolomics analysis of lyophilized root exudates revealed\nthe presence of numerous plant metabolites, 86 of which were\nidentified by matching their spectra to the LECO/Fiehn\nMetabolomics library (Supplementary Table 3). These\nmetabolites included (i) carbohydrates and their derivatives\n(glucose, fructose, xylose, sucrose, trehalose, maltose, galactose,\nand others); (ii) sugar alcohols (b-mannosylglycerate, myoinositol,\ngalactinol, 2-deoxyerythritol, ribitol, threitol and\ncellobitol); (iii) amino acids and derivatives (glutamine,\ntyrosine, glutamic acid, asparagine, aspartic acid, valine,\nphenylalanine, isoleucine, glycine, serine, proline, leucine,\ntryptophan, cysteine, methionine, citrulline, and others); (iv)\norganic acids (aconitic, allantoic, g-aminobutyric, azelaic, citric,\nfumaric, 2-furoic, D-glyceric, 3-hydroxypropionic, a-ketoadipic,\nmalic, methylmalonic, nicotinic, quinic, succinic, threonic);\nand (v) assorted metabolites including heterocyclic compounds,\nphenolics, and biogenic amines, etc (3-hydroxypyridine,\nmaleimide, noradrenaline, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoate,\n5-methoxytryptamine, uracil, aminomalonic acid, palmitic acid,\nand urea). Results of the analysis also revealed that root exudates\nof B. distachyon contain hydroxyectoine and the quaternary\namine (QA) glycine betaine (Supplementary Figure 1).\nPhylogenetic and Pangenome Analyses\nof Pseudomonas Strains Used in the\nStudy\nWe used a set of phylogenetic markers suggested by Mulet et al.\n(2010) to investigate the relatedness of the eight strains used in\nthis study to distinct lineages recognized within the P. fluorescens\nspecies complex. The multilocus sequence analysis based on\nthe concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S\nrRNA), gyrB, rpoB, and rpoD identified R1-43-08 (along with\nstrains 2-79 and SBW25) as a member of the P. fluorescens\nsubgroup (Figure 1). The rest of the strains clustered closely with\nfour additional subgroups of the P. fluorescens complex, namely\nP. corrugata (strains Q2-87 and Q8r1-96), P. koreensis (Pf0-1),\nP. protegens (Pf-5), and P. chlororaphis (30–84). The genomes of\nthe eight rhizosphere Pseudomonas strains varied in size by 1.43\nmegabase (ranging from 5.65 to 7.07 Mb) and contained between\n5,166 and 6,363 protein-coding genes (Figure 2A). The shared\ngene content was characterized with OrthoMCL, which uses allagainst-\nall BLASTp followed by the Markov Cluster algorithm to\nidentify protein groups shared between the compared genomes,\nas well as groups representing species-specific gene expansion\nfamilies (Li et al., 2003). The pangenome analysis revealed a\ncore comprised of approximately 3,179 orthologs that were\nshared among all strains and represented 50.0% to 61.5%\nof each predicted proteome (Figures 2A,B). The non-core\npangenome contained genes shared by two or more (but not\nall) strains and contained between 1,482 and 2,080 orthologs,\nwhich corresponded to 28.7–36.3% of individual proteomes. The\nrest of the predicted protein-coding genes were strain-specific\nsingletons that comprised 7.5% to 15.1% of the strain’s predicted\nproteomes. In respect to divergence from the core genome, strain\nPf-5 was found to possess the highest proportion of unique genes\n(n = 949) followed by 2-79 (n = 887). The entire pangenome of\nthe Pseudomonas strains encompassed over 12,000 homolog and\nsingleton gene families.\nFurther homolog family-based comparisons identified Q8r1-\n96 and R1-43-08 as the most distantly related strains, with\n3349 shared homologs (Supplementary Table 4A). Q8r1-96 and\nQ2-87, which shared 4,489 homologs, were the most closely\nrelated strains. The partitioning of homolog gene families into\nthe core, non-core, and singleton parts of the pangenome agreed\nwith phylogenetic relationships of the strains deduced from the\nanalysis of a selected subset of COGs (Clusters of Orthologous\nGroups) (Figure 2C and Supplementary Tables 4B,C). The\nCOG-based phylogeny supported the multilocus sequence\nanalysis and revealed that the eight Pseudomonas strains form\nthree distinct clusters, the first of which contained 2-79, R1-30-\n84, and SBW25. The second cluster included Q8r1-96 and Q2-87,\nwhereas the third encompassed strains 30-84, Pf-5, and Pf0-1.\nCorrelating the Composition of Root\nExudates With Metabolic Profiles of\nPseudomonas Strains\nWe used the Phenotype MicroArray PM1 and PM2 plates to\nprofile the eight Pseudomonas strains for the utilization of\n190 different carbon sources. Results of the analysis identified\n90 compounds that supported growth and clustered by their\nintensities of utilization into three distinct groups (Figure 3).\nGroup I was comprised of 30 highly metabolized carbon\nsources, which included several amino acids and intermediates of\nglycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, and citrate cycle. Approximately\nhalf of these compounds were catabolized by all eight strains,\nand included several organic acids (fumaric, citric, gluconic,\nmalic, and pyroglutamic), amino acids (Glu, Asn, Gln, Asp, Pro,\nAla, and g-aminobutyric acid), carbohydrates (glucose, mannose,\nand mannitol), and the purine nucleoside inosine. Group II\nwas composed of 44 chemically diverse carbon sources that\nwere variably utilized by the strains. These compounds were\ncarbohydrates, organic acids, amino acids, phenolics, and polyols,\nand included known compatible solutes and intermediates of\nmetabolism of pentoses, galactose, starch, and sucrose. Group\nIII encompassed the rest of the Phenotype MicroArray test\npanel and contained compounds that were not catabolized\nby the tested strains. Among several notable exceptions were\na-hydroxyglutamic acid- g-lactone, putrescine, and itaconic,\ncitramalic, and succinamic acids, which supported the growth\nof strains 2-79, 30-84, Pf-5, and SBW25. We further matched\nthe carbon metabolic profiles of the Pseudomonas strains against\nthe list of plant-derived metabolites from the root exudates of\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 5 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nFIGURE 1 | Neighbor joining phylogeny showing the relationship of the eight strains used in this study (indicated by red triangles) to different species of the\nP. fluorescens complex. The phylogeny was established based on the concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S rRNA), gyrB (subunit B of DNA\ngyrase), rpoB (b subunit of RNA polymerase), and rpoD (sigma 70 factor subunit of RNA polymerase). Distance matrices were calculated by the Jukes-Cantor\nmethod. Colored circles on tree nodes indicate bootstrap values (1,000 replicates) that vary between 60% (smallest circle) and 100% (largest circles).\nB. distachyon Bd21. Interestingly, many carbon sources from\nthe Phenotype MicroArray panel were also present in the root\nexudates of B. distachyon Bd21, and some of these compounds\n(glucose, mannose, galactose, fructose, g-aminobutyric acid,\naspartic acid, citric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, quinic acid,\nalanine, glutamine, and glutamic acid) were catabolized by all\nstrains used in this study, while others (e.g., xylose, trehalose,\nm-inositol) were actively utilized only by certain organisms\n(Figure 3). The comparison of catabolic profiles across the\neight studied Pseudomonas strains revealed the presence of three\ndistinct clusters. The first cluster contained strains Q8r1-96 and\nQ2-87, which consumed very similar sets of carbon sources,\nas well as strain Pf0-1. The second cluster was composed of\n2-79, R1-43-08, SBW25, and 30-84, whereas the third cluster\nwas represented by a single strain, Pf-5. The overall similarity\nof the catabolic profiles partially agreed with the separation\nof the strains into different subgroups of the P. fluorescens\ncomplex (see above).\nAnalysis of the RNA-seq Results\nIn order to understand the cellular responses of rhizosphere\nPseudomonas to plant exometabolites, we analyzed the\ntranscriptome changes in cultures grown in the presence of\nroot exudates. Under field conditions, rhizobacteria colonize\nplant roots in the form of surface-attached microaerobic biofilms\n(Hojberg et al., 1999). To mimic these conditions, the eight\nPseudomonas strains were grown statically at 72% air saturation\nin 21C-glucose medium amended with root exudates and then\nprocessed to extract total RNA (Supplementary Figure 2).\nA total of 995 million raw sequencing reads were generated from\nthe RNA samples by using the Illumina HiSeq-2500 platform,\naveraging 20.7 million reads per sample. The removal of lowquality\nand rRNA sequences resulted in a total of 793 million\nfiltered reads that were mapped onto the eight Pseudomonas\ngenomes with a mean of 7.48 million mapped fragments per\ngenome. The differentially abundant transcripts were identified\nby setting a p value of 0.05 (adjusted for multiple testing) and\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 6 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

(B) The gradual expansion of\nthe pangenome (blue color) and contraction of the core genome (green color) following the sequential addition of genomes from the dataset. Box plots indicate the\n25th and 75th percentiles and medians (horizontal lines) with whiskers corresponding to the 10th and 90th percentiles. The input order was randomized to avoid any\nbias due to the sequential addition of new genomes. The pangenome size increases steadily without reaching a plateau even after the addition of 11,939\nnon-redundant gene families. At the same time, the core genome converged to 3,179 genes. (C) The pangenome-based phylogenomic analysis of the studied\nstrains. Here, the pangenome was defined with OrthoMCL, and orthologous gene sets were then partitioned into the core, singleton, and non-core (the remaining\northolog sets) categories. These categories were calculated for each node in the Maximum Likelihood species tree, using the set of genomes for which that node\nrepresents the ancestor. The results of the ortholog partitioning are shown in pie charts placed at tree nodes. Numbers indicate bootstrap support values. The\nanalysis was conducted in KBase (Arkin et al., 2018).\nthe log2 fold-change (FC) threshold \u2000\u2000 2.0 (Figure 4 and\nSupplementary Tables 5–12). When compared with the control\nconditions, an average of 204 genes per strain were differentially\nexpressed in the presence of root exudates, with the highest\n(n = 425) and lowest (n = 112) numbers observed, respectively,\nin SBW25 and Q2-87 (Figure 4). Overall, more genes were\ninduced than repressed in response to exudates, but the actual\nnumbers in each category varied substantially depending on the\nidentity of the Pseudomonas strain. In most strains, the bulk of\nthe differentially expressed genes was almost equally distributed\nbetween the core (mean, 48.2%) and non-core (mean, 45.8%)\nparts of the genome, whereas the strain-specific singleton genes\nconstituted on average only 5.9% (Figure 4B). One notable\nexception was observed in Q8r1-96, where all differentially\nexpressed genes belonged to the core (73.8%) and non-core\n(26.2%) parts of the genome. Another notable pattern was\nobserved in R1-43-08, where the majority of genes affected by\nthe presence of root exudate fell into the non-core category\n(56.3%). The highest proportion of differentially expressed\nsingletons (11.3 and 10.4%, respectively) was identified in\nstrains SBW25 and Pf-5.\nWe further explored how the identified differentially\nexpressed genes were distributed across genomes of the eight\nstudied rhizosphere strains. The pairwise BLASTp comparisons\nidentified 2-79 and SBW25 as two strains that shared the highest\nnumber of genes (n = 101) induced or repressed in response\nto root exudates (Table 1). The second pair of strains with\na significant number of similar differentially expressed genes\n(n = 86) was Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, which was followed by Pf0-1\nand 30-84, which shared 56 differentially expressed genes. These\npatterns of shared genes were also observed when the results of\nthe pairwise BLASTp comparisons were converted into a binary\ngene presence/absence matrix, which was then subjected to\ncluster analysis using a UPGMA algorithm based on Sorensen’s\ndissimilarity index or examined by non-metric multidimensional\nscaling (NMDS) (Figure 5).\nThe differentially expressed Pseudomonas genes were\nsubjected to Blast2Go analysis and Gene Ontology (GO)\nannotation (Figure 6). Metabolic process, catalytic activity,\nand membrane were the most common annotation terms\nacross the three primary GO term categories (i.e., biological\nprocess, molecular function, and cellular component). A total\nof 1,694 GO terms was assigned to 805 upregulated genes, with\nthe majority of the GO terms related to molecular function\n(682, 40.3%), followed by biological process (669, 39.5%), and\ncellular component (343, 20.2%). In the 539 downregulated gene\ncategory, 1,101 GO terms were assigned to biological process\n(420, 38.1%), molecular function (417, 37.9%), and cellular\ncomponent (264, 24.0%). Within biological process, metabolic\nprocess, cellular process, localization, response to stimulus, and\nregulation were over-represented. Within molecular function,\nthe largest proportion was assigned to catalytic activity, binding,\nand transporter activity categories. Within cellular component,\nthe majority were assigned to membrane, membrane part, cell,\nand cell part categories. Across the eight strains, 37–42% of\ndifferentially expressed genes had no Gene Ontology IDs and\nencoded various conserved hypothetical proteins.\nFunctional Classification of Shared\nDifferentially Expressed Genes\nThe interrogation of RNA-seq data revealed multiple cellular\npathways that were differentially regulated in bacterial cultures\nincubated with root exudates (Supplementary Figures 3, 4).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 7 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nFIGURE 3 | Biolog Phenotype MicroArray profiling the eight rhizosphere\nPseudomonas strains used in the study. The hierarchical clustering analysis\nwas carried out using the average linkage method with Euclidean distances.\nCarbon sources identified by red arrowheads were also detected in the sterile\nroot exudates of B. distachyon Bd21.\nAlthough none of these differentially regulated pathways were\nshared by all eight strains, the cross-strain comparisons revealed\nseveral types of common and specific transcriptomic responses\nthat were elicited by the presence of plant exometabolites\n(Table 2). The visual representation of core gene expression\npatterns is provided in Supplementary Figure 5, which\nshows heatmaps of expression profiles and p-adj values for\ncore genes shared by the studied strains. The figure is\naccompanied by Supplementary Table 13 that lists predicted\nfunctions of genes constituting the four distinct clusters\nobserved after hierarchical clustering of gene expression\nvalues. The first category of shared differentially expressed\npathways functioned in the uptake and catabolism of selected\ncarbohydrates, quaternary ammonium compounds (QAs), and\nphenolics. All strains except for R1-43-08, responded to root\nexudates by inducing the fructose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate\n(PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTSFru). The\ncomponents of this system are encoded by a conserved\noperon and include the cytoplasmic polyprotein EI/HPr/EIIAFru\n(FruB), the 1-phosphofructokinase FruK, and the fructosespecific\npermease EIIBC (FruA) (Chavarria et al., 2016). The\nPTSFru system functions by acquiring high-energy phosphates\nfrom PEP and sequentially passing them, via the EI/HPr/EIIAFru\ndomains of FruB, to the EIIB component of FruA. The\nphosphates are ultimately transferred by the EIIC transporter\nto fructose yielding fructose 1-phosphate, which is channeled\ninto the central metabolic pathways through the action of the\nphosphofructokinase FruK.\nIn all strains except for Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, the exposure to root\nexudates resulted in the induction of two genes adjacent to the\nfru cluster that encoded a Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS)\ntransporter and an L-arabinonate dehydratase (Table 2). These\ngenes are predicted to participate in the uptake and catabolism\nof L-arabinose, where L-arabinonate dehydratase plays an\nimportant role by converting L-arabinonate to 2-dehydro-3-\ndeoxy-L-arabinonate (Rahman et al., 2017). In SBW25, R1-\n43-08, and Q2-87, we also observed the induction of genes\nencoding components of the AraFGH complex, an ATP-Binding\nCassette (ABC) superfamily transporter involved in the import of\narabinose into the cell (Supplementary Tables 6, 7, 9). Finally, all\nstrains except SBW25 and R1-43-08 responded to the presence\nof exudates by upregulating a conserved gene encoding an\naldose epimerase superfamily protein. Such enzymes equilibrate\nalpha- and beta-anomers of aldoses and ensure that stereospecific\nenzymes involved in the metabolism of free sugars do not act as\nmetabolic bottlenecks (Abayakoon et al., 2018). Although some\naldose epimerases have been linked to specific pathways, the\nPseudomonas gene identified in this study could not be assigned\nto a particular metabolic process based on sequence analysis and\ngenomic location.\nSeveral Pseudomonas strains responded to the presence\nof root exudates by upregulating genes involved in the\nuptake and catabolism of myo-inositol and possibly other\nstereoisomers of inositol (Table 2). The upregulated catabolic\ngenes encode the dehydrogenase IolG, which oxidizes myoinositol\nto its corresponding ketone, as well as IolE, IolD, IolB,\nand IolC that collectively convert the 2-keto-myo-inositol to\nacetyl-CoA and the glycolysis intermediate dihydroxyacetone\nphosphate (Yoshida et al., 2008; Kohler et al., 2011).

The cross-genome comparisons revealed\nthat in all studied strains except for Pf0-1, components\nof the myo-inositol utilization pathway were encoded\nwithin a well-conserved gene cluster which, in addition to\ncatabolic and transport functions, also encodes a dedicated\ntranscriptional repressor.\nAll studied strains of Pseudomonas carry multiple genes\ninvolved in scavenging the quaternary ammonium compounds\ncholine, glycine betaine (GB), carnitine, choline-O-sulfate, and\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 9 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

Many of these genes were\ndifferentially expressed, including those encoding parts of the\nABC transporter CbcXWV, which is predicted to function in\nthe uptake of choline under water-replete conditions (Table 2).\nAmong enzymes induced in the presence of root exudates were\nthe choline dehydrogenase BetA, which converts choline to\nglycine betaine and a network of enzymes (i.e., the Rieske family\noxygenase GbcAB, the dimethyglycine demethylase DgcAB, and\nthe sarcosine oxidase SoxBDAG) that sequentially convert GB\nto glycine. In 2-79 and SBW25, this group of differentially\nregulated genes also included an AraC-family transcriptional\nactivator GbdR, which perceives intercellular levels of GB and\ninduces genes involved in the transport and catabolism of\nglycine betaine and detoxification of the catabolic byproducts\n(Hampel et al., 2014).\nThe last category of activated catabolic pathways included the\ncatechol branch of the b-ketoadipate pathway for the degradation\nof aromatic compounds. In strains 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5,\ngrowth on root exudates resulted in upregulation of catechol-\n1,2-dioxygenase, muconate cycloisomerase, and muconolactone\nisomerase, which collectively cleave the catechol ring and\nconvert it to b-ketoadipate enol-lactone (Harwood and Parales,\n1996). Finally, analysis of the P. synxantha 2-79 transcriptome\nidentified an induction of benABC genes encoding subunits\nof benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase, an oxidoreductase that generates\ncatechol from benzoate.\nIn addition to various catabolic pathways, the exposure to root\nexudates also induced several genes involved in the homeostasis\nof copper (Table 2). Four of these genes form a conserved cluster\nin genomes of the strains and encode the periplasmic coppersensing\ntwo-component system CinRS, the plastocyanin/azurinlike\nprotein CinA, and the NADPH-dependent pre-Q0 reductase\nCinQ. Also, in strains Q2-87, 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, we observed\nupregulation of a conserved operon encoding the multicopper\noxidase CopA, the periplasmic copper-binding protein CopC, the\ninner membrane protein CopD, and outer membrane protein\nCopB. In several Gram-negative bacteria, these Cop proteins are\nthought to have dual functions and participate both in the uptake\nof essential copper as well as in the sequestration of excess copper\nin the periplasm and outer membrane.\nThe analysis of shared downregulated pathways revealed that\nmost of the strains respond to the presence of root exudates by\nrepressing genes involved in the uptake and catabolism of sulfur\ncompounds (Table 2). In strains SBW25, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96,\nQ2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, this response involved the ssuEADCB\noperon responsible for the utilization of alkanesulfonates\nas sulfur sources. The ssu operon is highly conserved in\nfluorescent pseudomonads and encodes the FMNH2-dependent\nmonooxygenase SsuD and the NAD (P)H-dependent FMN\nreductase SsuE, which together catalyze the desulfonation of\nalkanesulfonates. Also, the ssu locus contains genes for the\nmolybdopterin-binding protein SsuF and the alkanesulfonatespecific\nABC-type transporter consisting of the sulfonate\nsubstrate-binding protein SsuA, sulfonate permease protein\nSsuC, and sulfonate transport ATP-binding protein SsuB. Finally,\nin R1-43-08, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, growth on root exudates\ncoincided with repression of the tauABCD operon, which\nallows these strains to utilize taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonate)\nas a sulfur source. The repressed tau genes encoded the\n2-oxoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenase TauD and\nsubstrate-binding, ATP-binding, and permease components of\nthe taurine-specific ABC transporter TauABC.\nOther Differentially Expressed Pathways\nIn addition to their effect on several shared cellular pathways,\ngrowth on root exudates resulted in the induction or repression of\nnumerous strain-specific genes. In closely related P. synxantha 2-\n79 and P. fluorescens SBW25, we observed differential expression\nof genes involved in energy metabolism, transport of amino\nacids, and surface attachment (Supplementary Tables 5, 6).\nOther notable differentially expressed pathways included 2–\n79 gene clusters that encode enzymes for the catabolism of\ntrehalose, a prophage, and toxin/antitoxin system, as well as the\nSBW25 operon predicted to control the synthesis of the capsular\nexopolysaccharide colonic acid. The response of Pseudomonas sp.\nR1-43-08 to root exudates also involved differential expression\nof different energy metabolism pathways. In addition, we\nobserved the upregulation of genes involved in the uptake and\ncatabolism of xylose (also upregulated in 2–79) and repression\nof enzymes for the biosynthesis of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid\nand assimilation of inorganic sulfur and L-cysteine biosynthesis\n(Supplementary Table 7).\nThe analysis of the Q8r1-96 transcriptome revealed\nperturbation of different metabolic pathways including genes\nencoding components of cytochrome C oxidase, transport\nand catabolism of sorbitol/mannitol, metabolism of butanoic\nacid, and biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides alginate and\npoly-b-1-6-N-acetylglucosamine (Supplementary Table 8). In\nP. fluorescens Q2-87, we identified differential expression of\ngenes involved in metabolism of galactose, tryptophan, tyrosine,\nglycine, serine, and threonine (Supplementary Table 9),\nwhile in P. chlororaphis 30-84, growth on exudates activated\nthe biosynthesis of molybdopterin cofactor, catabolism of\ngalactonate and acetoin, and uptake and catabolism of putrescine\n(Supplementary Table 10). The response of P. protegens Pf-5 to\nroot exudates involved upregulation of acetoin dehydrogenase,\nwhich converts acetoin to acetaldehyde and acetyl-CoA, as\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 10 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

The terms were derived from 93 different functional groups (GO subcategories level 4). The GO terms were assigned with Blast2GO (Conesa\nand Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al., 2018). On a WEGO histogram, the percentage of 100 is defined as the total number of genes assigned a GO\nterm. However, the subcategories do not add up to 100% because many genes fall into more than one functional class and are therefore annotated by multiple GO\nterms.\nwell as pathways for the utilization of glycolate and putrescine\n(Supplementary Table 11). Also induced were genes for\nthe production of pyrrolnitrin and PhlG hydrolase, which\nmodulate the metabolic loads attributed to the synthesis of\n2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol. The differentially expressed genes of\nP. fluorescens Pf0-1 included, among others, operons encoding\ncytochrome C oxidase and enzymes for catabolism of malonic\nacid (Supplementary Table 12). Yet another interesting\nfinding involved the induction of assorted genes acting in the\nhomeostasis of iron and defense against reactive oxygen species\n(ROS). We observed activation of iron dicitrate transporters\n(SBW25 and 30-84), genes for the biosynthesis of siderophores\nornicorrugatin (SBW25) and pyochelin (Pf-5), heme-degrading\nenzymes (2–79, 30–84), TonB siderophore receptors, and\ncomponents of the energy-transducing inner membrane\ncomplex TonB-ExbB-ExbD (2–79 and Pf-5). The differentially\nexpressed ROS defense pathways were represented by different\ncatalases in strains 2–79, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and\nPf-5 and organic hydroperoxide resistance proteins in strains\nSBW25 and R1-43-08.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nsoil microorganisms. Our results were in agreement with a\nrecent report of 27 different sugars, amino acids, and organic\nacids in Brachypodium exudates (Kawasaki et al., 2016). We\nconfirmed the presence of exometabolites identified in that\nstudy, along with dozens of additional analytes that were\nidentified by matching their mass-spectra and retention indices\nto the LECO/Fiehn Metabolomics library (Supplementary\nTable 3). The complementation of the metabolomic analysis\nwith profiling of the bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays\nrevealed that a substantial proportion of the characterized\nexudate constituents were catabolized by a collection of eight\nPseudomonas strains from across the P. fluorescens group that is\nknown to form associations with plant roots. The amendment\nof Pseudomonas cultures with root exudates caused changes in\nthe expression of multiple genes encoding catabolic and anabolic\nenzymes, predicted transporters, transcriptional regulators, stress\nresponse, and conserved hypothetical proteins. In most strains,\nthese differentially expressed genes were almost equally split\nbetween the core and variable genome regions, mirroring\nthe substantial strain-to-strain variation in the genome size\nand gene content within the P. fluorescens species complex\n(Loper et al., 2012).\nThe analysis of transcriptome responses to root exudates\nrevealed several types of cellular pathways present in the strains\nused in this study. The first category of such pathways was\ninvolved in the catabolism of carbohydrates such as fructose,\narabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, trehalose, and galactose. Among\nthese catabolic traits, the ability to utilize fructose as a carbon\nsource is highly conserved among fluorescent pseudomonads.\nIn contrast, growth on arabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, and\ntrehalose is variably present and was traditionally used to\ndifferentiate species and biovars within the P. fluorescens\ngroup (Barrett et al., 1986). We speculate that such variably\ndistributed pathways contribute to the differential affinity of\npseudomonads toward host plants and/or to determine which\nstrains flourish in response to growing roots and changing\nenvironments. Several independent studies have confirmed\nthe importance of carbohydrate catabolism pathways for the\nbiology of rhizosphere pseudomonads. For example, in vivo\nexpression technology (IVET) profiling of P. fluorescens SBW25\nidentified xylose isomerase among genome regions essential\nfor the colonization of sugar beet seedlings (Liu et al., 2015),\nwhereas a genome-wide Tn-Seq screen of Pseudomonas simiae\nidentified genes for the catabolism of myo-inositol among traits\nessential for the colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana roots\n(Cole et al., 2017).\nThe response of rhizosphere Pseudomonas to Brachypodium\nroot exudates also involved pathways for the uptake and\nmetabolism of amino acids. We observed differential\nexpression of genes encoding the hydrophobic (HAAT) and\npolar (PAAT) amino acid uptake transporters in strains\n2-79, SBW25, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5. Other related genes\nencoded enzymes for the catabolism of valine and glutamic\nacid (2-79); metabolism of tryptophan, glycine, serine, and\nthreonine (Q2-87); and biosynthesis of methionine (Q8r1-\n96). It is plausible that the abundance of amino acids in\nroot exudates is also linked to the repression of pathways\ninvolved in the catabolism of sulfonates and taurine that\nwas observed in several strains (Table 2). Although the\npreferred source of sulfur for P. fluorescens is unknown, in the\nclosely related P. aeruginosa, the sulfur starvation response\nis triggered by the growth on any sulfur compound other\nthan sulfate, thiocyanate, and cysteine (Hummerjohann et al.,\n1998). This fact, together with the presence of cysteine and\ncystine in the root exudates, suggest that root exudates of\nBrachypodium may serve as an important source of sulfur for\nrhizosphere Pseudomonas. These findings also agree well with\nthe reported scarcity of inorganic sulfate in the soil, and the\npresence of sulfur mostly in the form of organic compounds,\nincluding amino acids, proteins, sulfate esters, and sulfonates\n(Autry and Fitzgerald, 1990).\nAnother interesting result of this study was the concerted\nactivation of copper and iron homeostasis pathways observed\nin all of the Pseudomonas strains used in this work. In bacteria,\nan excess of copper is toxic and triggers oxidative stress due to\nthe formation of free radicals, as well as disruption of protein\nmetalation and stability of iron-sulfur clusters (Bondarczuk\nand Piotrowska-Seget, 2013). On the other hand, copper is an\nessential trace element used as a cofactor in different enzymes.\nSimilarly, although elevated levels of iron cause redox stress, this\nelement is also found in active energy metabolism enzymes and is\ncrucial for bacterial growth (Andrews et al., 2003). The analysis\nof metal homeostasis genes identified in this study suggests\nthat their induction was likely triggered by the deficiency of\ncopper and iron in bacterial cultures grown in the presence of\nroot exudates. We attribute this effect to the ability of some\ncomponents of root exudates to chelate soil metals.\nDespite the abundance of iron in the soil, its bioavailability\nis limited due to the low solubility of Fe (III) oxyhydrates\nat neutral pH. The non-graminaceous plants circumvent this\nproblem by acidifying the rhizosphere and secreting flavins,\nphenolics, and organic acids that chelate iron. The reduction\nof these ferric chelates releases soluble ferrous iron taken up\nby root cells (Kobayashi and Nishizawa, 2012). Graminaceous\nplants, like Brachypodium, acquire iron by secreting into the\nsoil non-protein amino acids of the mugineic acid (MA) group,\nwhich act as Fe (III)-chelating phytosiderophores. In addition to\niron, low-molecular-weight organic acids and phytosiderophores\nbind other divalent and trivalent metals (including copper) and\ncontribute to heavy-metal tolerance in plants (Chen et al., 2017).\nIt is plausible that the presence of these plant exometabolites\nis responsible for the deficit of iron and copper observed in\nPseudomonas cultures grown in the presence of root exudates.\nThese results further underscore the importance of diverse and\nredundant metal homeostasis pathways found in genomes of the\nP. fluorescens group for the ability of these organisms to colonize\nand persist in the plant rhizosphere.\nRecently, Klonowska et al. (2018) examined transcriptomic\nresponses of symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria to root\nexudates of the legume plant Mimosa pundica, which has\nan unusual ability to support both alpha- (Rhizobium) and\nbeta-rhizobia (Cupriavidus and Burkholderia). Using RNA-seq,\nthe authors characterized genes involved in the perception of\nroot exudates in the nodulating bacteria Burkholderia phymatum\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 14 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nSTM815, Cupriavidus taiwanensis LMG19424, and Rhizobium\nmesoamericanum STM3625. Interestingly, the analysis of\ndifferentially expressed genes revealed induction of pathways\ninvolved in the catabolism of fructose, xylose, myo-inositol,\nand protocatechuate/catechol. Also upregulated were some\ncopper homeostasis, siderophore biosynthesis, and oxidative\nstress genes. Finally, the analytical profiling of M. pundica\nexudates revealed an overlap with Brachypodium in the types of\ncarbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids present. These\nfindings suggest that differentially expressed genes shared by\nmultiple strains of the group P. fluorescens are not unique to\nthe Brachypodium-Pseudomonas system but represent a set\nof conserved cellular pathways involved in the perception of\nplant exometabolites by different clades of rhizosphere-dwelling\nProteobacteria.\nMost strains included in this study were originally selected\nbased on the ability to colonize the rhizosphere and produce\nsecondary metabolites that alleviate the plant stress response\nand/or inhibit soilborne pathogens. It has been suggested\nthat plant metabolites released into the rhizosphere affect\nthe biocontrol activity of plant-beneficial pseudomonads (de\nWerra et al., 2011). We provide further support to this\nhypothesis by demonstrating that in some strains, root exudates\nmodulate the expression of genes for the catabolism of\nthe plant growth-promoting metabolites acetoin and 2,3-\nbutanediol. The exposure to exudates also affected the expression\nof genes for the synthesis of well-characterized antifungal\ncompounds pyrrolnitrin, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, and 2,4-\ndiacetylphloroglucinol. The modulatory effects were strainspecific,\nsuggesting significant differences in the regulatory\nnetworks involved in the perception of plant signals and\nregulation of the production of antibiotics and growthpromoting\nmetabolites.\nThe final significant finding of this study was the induction\nof catabolism of quaternary amines (QAs) observed in multiple\nstrains of the P. fluorescens group during growth on root\nexudates. This observation was supported by the detection of\nglycine betaine in the root secretions of B. distachyon. The\npresence of QAs in plant tissues and the capacity of these\nmetabolites to provide stress protection and nutrients to plant\npathogens and symbionts were reported before (Boncompagni\net al., 1999; Chen et al., 2013; Kabbadj et al., 2017), but our\nstudy is among the first to highlight the potential importance of\nthese metabolites for rhizosphere interactions. Pseudomonads do\nnot synthesize QAs de novo but have evolved many pathways to\nscavenge them from eukaryotic hosts, where these metabolites\nare abundant due to the prominence of phosphatidylcholine\nin cellular membranes. Strains of P. fluorescens carry genes\nfor the conversion of choline, carnitine, and glycine betaine to\nglycine, as well as quaternary amine transporters of the BCCT\nand ABC families that are also conserved in the opportunistic\nhuman pathogen P. aeruginosa and the plant pathogen P. syringae\n(Galvao et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2013; Wargo, 2013b).\nIn P. aeruginosa, choline catabolism genes are essential for\nthe ability of this pathogen to persist during lung infection\n(Wargo, 2013a). Similarly, a P. syringae mutant deficient in\nBetT, OpuC, and CbcXWV quaternary amine transporters had\nreduced fitness during colonization of bean and soybean leaves\nunder greenhouse and field conditions (Chen et al., 2013).\nDepending on water availability, P. aeruginosa and P. syringae\ncatabolize exogenously supplied QAs as carbon and nitrogen\nsources or accumulate them as osmoprotectants (Chen et al.,\n2013; Wargo, 2013b). Our ongoing work in P. synxantha 2–\n79 unraveled similar physiological responses and demonstrated\nthat QA transporters function differentially and redundantly\nin the uptake of quaternary amines as nutrients (Pablo and\nMavrodi, unpublished). In contrast, under water stress, the QAs\ncholine, betaine, and carnitine are accumulated preferentially for\nosmoprotection. Under drought stress, a 2–79 mutant devoid\nof all known QA transporters was less competitive in the\ncolonization of the Brachypodium rhizosphere than its wild-type\nparental strain. Interestingly, our metabolomic profiling of root\nexudates also revealed proline, glutamine, and hydroxyectoine.\nThese metabolites act as compatible solutes in different groups\nof microorganisms (Yancey et al., 1982; Empadinhas and da\nCosta, 2008), suggesting an important role of root exudates\nin the ability of Pseudomonas to persist in the rhizosphere of\ndrought-stressed plants.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe original contributions presented in the study are publicly\navailable.

Plant roots secrete carbon-rich rhizodeposits containing primary and\nsecondary low molecular weight metabolites, lysates, and mucilages. These exudates\nprovide nutrients for soil microorganisms and modulate their affinity to host plants, but\nmolecular details of this process are largely unresolved. We addressed this gap by\nfocusing on the molecular dialog between eight well-characterized beneficial strains\nof the Pseudomonas fluorescens group and Brachypodium distachyon, a model for\neconomically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops of the grass family. We\ncollected and analyzed root exudates of B. distachyon and demonstrated the presence\nof multiple carbohydrates, amino acids, organic acids, and phenolic compounds. The\nsubsequent screening of bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays revealed that many\nof these metabolites provide carbon and energy for the Pseudomonas strains. RNAseq\nprofiling of bacterial cultures amended with root exudates revealed changes in the\nexpression of genes encoding numerous catabolic and anabolic enzymes, transporters,\ntranscriptional regulators, stress response, and conserved hypothetical proteins. Almost\nhalf of the differentially expressed genes mapped to the variable part of the strains’\npangenome, reflecting the importance of the variable gene content in the adaptation of\nP. fluorescens to the rhizosphere lifestyle.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nINTRODUCTION\nPlants are meta-organisms or holobionts that rely in part on\ntheir microbiome for specific functions and traits. The ability\nof the plant microbiome to influence plant development, vigor,\nhealth, and fitness in response to abiotic stressors associated\nwith global climate change is documented by numerous studies\n(Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009). There is mounting evidence\nthat plants actively recruit beneficial microbiomes, but many\naspects of this process are still very much a black box (Reinhold-\nHurek et al., 2015). The foundation for the differential affinity\nof rhizobacteria toward host plants is built upon complex\nchemical cross talk between microorganisms and plant roots.\nUp to 40% of photosynthetically fixed carbon is released by\nplant roots in the form of exudates and secretions, lysates, and\nmucilages (Curl and Truelove, 1986; Lynch, 1990; Whipps, 1990;\nBadri and Vivanco, 2009). The release of these compounds is\nactively controlled in response to environmental stimuli, and the\ncomposition of root exudates varies greatly according to plant\nspecies and physiological condition (Lynch, 1990; Nguyen, 2003;\nPhillips et al., 2004; De-la-Pena et al., 2008). The presence and\ncomposition of exudates strongly impact soil microorganisms,\nwhich is consistent with the idea that plants actively select and\nshape their root microbiota (Zolla et al., 2013).\nPrimary root exudates include simple and complex sugars,\namino acids, polypeptides and proteins, organic, aliphatic and\nfatty acids, sterols, and phenolics (Nguyen, 2003; Badri and\nVivanco, 2009; Badri et al., 2009). These compounds serve as\ncarbon and energy sources for rhizobacteria, and the presence\nof the intact corresponding catabolic pathways is essential\nfor competitive colonization of roots and disease suppression\n(Lugtenberg et al., 2001; Kamilova et al., 2005; Lugtenberg and\nKamilova, 2009). Root exudates also contain numerous signal\nmolecules and secondary metabolites, the significance of which\nis only now emerging (Walker et al., 2003; Bais et al., 2005,\n2006). A handful of analyses of plant-induced gene expression\nby transcriptional profiling in vitro (Mark et al., 2005) or in\nthe rhizosphere (Silby and Levy, 2004; Ramos-Gonzalez et al.,\n2005; Matilla et al., 2007; Barret et al., 2009) have identified\nmultiple genes that are differentially regulated by exposure to\nroots or root exudates. Bacterial pathways expressed during\nrhizosphere colonization control utilization of plant-derived\nmetabolites (Simons et al., 1996, 1997; Camacho-Carvajal, 2001;\nLugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), motility and chemotaxis (de\nWeert et al., 2002; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), phase\nvariation (Dekkers et al., 1998; Sanchez-Contreras et al., 2002;\nvan den Broek et al., 2005), outer membrane integrity (de Weert\net al., 2006; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), and the ability\nto sequester limiting resources (Raaijmakers et al., 1995) and\nresist environmental stresses (Sarniguet et al., 1995; Miller and\nWood, 1996; van Veen et al., 1997; Schnider-Keel et al., 2001). In\nits spatial and temporal properties, root colonization resembles\nbiofilm formation, and biofilm-related pathways also have been\nimplicated in adhesion to seeds and roots and rhizosphere\ncolonization (Espinosa-Urgel et al., 2000; Hinsa et al., 2003;\nYousef-Coronado et al., 2008; Fuqua, 2010; Martinez-Gil et al.,\n2010; Nielsen et al., 2011; Zboralski and Filion, 2020). Finally,\nroot exudates strongly affect the expression of diverse plant\ngrowth promotion and biocontrol genes (Vacheron et al., 2013).\nOver the past decade, the genomes of numerous rhizosphere\nstrains have been sequenced and analyzed, but functional\ngenomics studies of rhizosphere competence lag behind the\navailability of sequence data.\nThis study explored the molecular dialog between the\nmodel host plant Brachypodium distachyon and several wellcharacterized\nrhizosphere strains of the Pseudomonas fluorescens\ngroup. Brachypodium is a small annual grass originating in semiarid\nregions of the Middle East that has emerged as a prime model\nfor economically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops\nof the grass family (Bevan et al., 2010; Schwartz et al., 2010;\nBrkljacic et al., 2011; Hong et al., 2011; Tyler et al., 2014). The\nbiology, extensive collection of resources, and research tools\nmake B. distachyon an attractive model to investigate interactions\nbetween plants and root-associated microbes. Pseudomonads\nare ubiquitous Gram-negative g-proteobacteria that colonize\neukaryotic hosts and include both commensals and economically\nimportant pathogens of plants and animals (Moore et al.,\n2006; Schroth et al., 2006; Yahr and Parsek, 2006). The genus\nPseudomonas currently comprises > 100 named species that have\nbeen separated based on multilocus sequence analysis into 14\nspecies groups (Garrido-Sanz et al., 2016; Hesse et al., 2018).\nThe P. fluorescens group is the most diverse regarding both\nthe genetic distances within it, the number of species and the\nlarge pangenome that makes up > 50% of the pangenome\nof the genus as a whole (Loper et al., 2012). The group also\nencompasses an unusually high proportion of strains that inhabit\nthe plant rhizosphere and possess plant growth promoting and\nbiocontrol properties. Naylor et al. (2017) profiled bacterial\ncommunities associated with root tissues and rhizosphere of\n18 different plant species of the Poaceae family. That study\nidentified Pseudomonas among taxa constituting the core grass\nroot microbiome and demonstrated that these bacteria were\nenriched in C3 plants, including wheat, rye, barley, oat, and\nBrachypodium. We confirmed the capacity of B. distachyon\nBd21 to serve as a host for rhizobacteria of the P. fluorescens\ngroup in preliminary greenhouse assays with biocontrol strains\nP. synxantha 2-79, P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96, and P. protegens\nPf-5. Results of these experiments revealed that all strains\nsuccessfully established and colonized the roots of Brachypodium\n(Supplementary Table 1).\nIn this study, we focused on eight well-studied strains\nof the P. fluorescens complex that are supported by years\nof studies, numerous refereed publications, and high-quality\ngenome sequences. By profiling transcriptomes of these strains\nduring growth in root exudates of B. distachyon, we revealed the\ndiversity of cellular pathways and physiological responses that\nunderlie the establishment of mutualistic interactions between\nbeneficial rhizobacteria and the host plant. Our results also\nconfirmed that root exudates contain carbohydrates, amino acids,\norganic acids, and phenolics that serve as carbon and energy\nsources for rhizobacteria. The root exudates also contained\nosmoprotectants that may help microorganisms to persist in the\nrhizosphere of drought-stressed plants.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nthe variable genome in adaptation of individual strains of\nPseudomonas to the rhizosphere lifestyle.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacterial Strains Used in the Study\nThe eight Pseudomonas strains used for this study are\nP. synxantha 2-79 (Thomashow and Weller, 1988), P. fluorescens\nSBW25 (Silby et al., 2009), Pseudomonas sp. R1-43-08 (Parejko\net al., 2012), P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96 (Raaijmakers and Weller,\n1998), P. fluorescens Q2-87 (Bangera and Thomashow, 1996),\nP. chlororaphis 30-84 (Thomashow et al., 1990), P. fluorescens\nPf0-1 (Silby et al., 2009), and P. protegens Pf-5 (Howell and\nStipanovic, 1980). The selected organisms have been studied\nextensively for their role in biological control and plant\ngrowth promotion (Supplementary Table 2). The strains were\nmaintained in the laboratory as frozen stocks (\U0010000080\u2000C) and\nroutinely cultured in King’s medium B (King et al., 1954) or\n21C medium, which contained (per 1 L): 1.0 g of NH4Cl, 3.5 g\nof Na2HPO4\u20002H2O, 2.8 g of KH2PO4, 3.0 g of glucose, and\n20 ml of a microelement solution (Smibert and Kreig, 1994;\nHalverson and Firestone, 2000).\nPropagation of Plants and Collection of\nRoot Exudates\nB. distachyon Bd21 was established from seed material obtained\nfrom the USDA-ARS Plant Germplasm Introduction and Testing\nResearch Unit (Pullman, WA, United States). Brachypodium\nseeds were imbibed for 3 days at 4\u2000C and sown in 7 \u2000 7 cm\npots filled with Sunshine Potting Mix #4 (Sun Gro Horticulture,\nAgawam, MA, United States). Plants were grown in an IR-\n89X (Percival Scientific, Perry, IA, United States) controlled\nenvironment chamber retrofitted with 6500K and 3000K T5 54W\ngrow lights (Spectralux) under a 20-h light, 24\u2000C/4-h dark, 18\u2000C\ncycle. Plants were watered and fertilized with Jack’s professional\nwater-soluble fertilizer (20:20:20) (JR Peters, Allentown, PA,\nUnited States). After 12 weeks and plant senescence, seeds\nwere collected, processed, and stored under desiccant and dark\nconditions at room temperature.\nTo collect root exudates, seeds of B. distachyon Bd21 were\nsurface-sterilized, pregerminated, and placed in sterile 1 L widemouth\nglass jars containing 113 g of 6-mm glass beads and\n25 ml distilled water. Jars were covered with vented caps\nand plants were grown hydroponically in an environmental\ncontrolled growth chamber under conditions described above.\nAfter 6 days, root exudates were extracted from individual\njars and their sterility was confirmed by spotting on nutrient\nagar. Multiple batches of root exudates were collected, filtered\n(0.22 mm), aliquoted in Falcon tubes (10 ml), lyophilized, and\nstored at –80\u2000C.\nMetabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates\nExudates were analyzed for primary metabolites at the Murdock\nMetabolomics Laboratory at Washington State University\n(Pullman, WA, United States). Freeze-dried residues were\nsuspended in 500 ml 50% aqueous acetonitrile and clarified by\ncentrifugation for 20 min at 21,000 \u2000 g and 4\u2000C. The liquid\nchromatography mass spectrometry analysis was conducted\nwith a Synapt G2-S quadrupole-ion mobility spectrometrytime\nof flight mass spectrometer system equipped with an\nacquity ultra-performance liquid chromatograph (UPLC) and\nan acquity photodiode array detector (all from Waters, Milford,\nMA, United States). The exudate metabolites were separated\non a SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC HPLC column (2.1 \u2000 100 mm,\n3 mm) (Milllipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, United States) using\nacetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid as solvent B and water\nwith 0.1% formic acid as solvent A at a flow rate of 400 ml\nmin\U001000001 and the following linear gradient extending over 14 min:\n0 min, 80% B; 4 min, 80% B, 6 min: 10% B; 7.5 min, 10%\nB; 10 min, 80% B; and 14 min, 80% B. Mass spectra were\ncollected in positive ion mode over a range of m/z 50–1,200\nwith a scan time of 0.2 s. The Q-TOF-MS source was at\n3.0 kV and 120\u2000C; the sampling cone at 40 V, desolvation\ntemperature was 250\u2000C; cone gas and desolvation gas flow were\nat 0 and 850 L h\U001000001, respectively. Leucine enkephalin was used\nfor post-acquisition mass correction. Target compounds were\nvisualized using selected ion chromatograms at 0.05 Da window\nwidth. The compound identification was based on comparison\nof chromatographic behavior and accurate masses to those of\nauthentic standards.\nFor gas chromatography, derivatization was carried out using\na modification of the procedure of Lee and Fiehn (2008).\nThe freeze-dried residues were suspended in 950 ml aqueous\nmethanol (84%, v/v) and clarified by centrifugation for 15 min\nat 21,000 \u2000 g at 4\u2000C. The supernatants were spiked with 1\nmg of the internal standard salicylic acid-d6 (C/D/N Isotopes,\nQuebec, Canada) and dried in vacuo. The dry residues were\nsuspended in 10 ml of O-methoxylamine hydrochloride (30 mg\nml\U001000001 in anhydrous pyridine, both from Millipore Sigma) and\nincubated while mixing (1,000 RPM) for 90 min at 30\u2000C.\nSubsequently, samples were derivatized with 90 ml of MSTFA\nwith 1% TMCS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,\nUnited States) for 30 min at 37\u2000C. Gas chromatography-mass\nspectroscopy analysis was performed using a Pegasus 4D timeof-\nflight mass spectrometer (LECO, Saint Joseph MI) equipped\nwith a MPS2 autosampler (Gerstel, Linthicum, MD) and a 7890A\noven (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States).\nThe derivatization products were separated on a 30-m, 0.25 mm\ni.d., 0.25 mm df Rxi-5Sil column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA,\nUnited States) with an IntegraGuard precolumn using ultrapure\nHe at a constant flow of 0.9 ml min\U001000001 as carrier gas. The linear\nthermal gradient started with a 1-min hold at 70\u2000C, followed\nby a ramp to 300\u2000C at 10\u2000C min\U001000001. The final temperature was\nheld for 5 min prior to returning to initial conditions. Mass\nspectra were collected at 17 spectra s\U001000001. Peak identification was\nconducted using the Fiehn primary metabolite library (Kind\net al., 2009) and an identity score cutoff of 700. Additionally,\nauthentic standards for a number of primary metabolites were\nanalyzed under identical conditions and the data used to compare\nthe chromatographic behavior. Peak alignment and spectrum\ncomparisons were carried out using the Statistical Compare\nfeature of ChromaTOF software (LECO).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 3 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nIsolation of RNA From Bacteria Cultured\nin Root Exudates and RNA-Seq\nThe strains were pregrown overnight at 25\u2000C on 21C-glucose\nagar and then subcultured into 96-well microplates containing\nliquid 21C-glucose medium amended with Brachypodium\nexudates. The liquid medium was prepared by dissolving the\nlyophilized root exudate material in an appropriate volume of\n21C-glucose medium to concentrate root exudates 20-fold. The\ngrowth medium was sterilized by passing it through a 0.22-\nmm membrane filter. The control cultures were grown under\nidentical conditions in the absence of exudates. All treatments\nwere inoculated at OD600 of 0.1 and incubated for 20 to\n22 h until cultures entered late-exponential growth phase at\n25\u2000C in an atmosphere of 15% oxygen [created by a ProOx\nP110 oxygen controller (BioSpherix, Parish, NY, United States)\nwith a hypoxia C-chamber]. The cells were stabilized by the\naddition RNAprotect reagent (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD,\nUnited States) and total RNA was purified using a RNeasy Protect\nBacteria Mini Kit (QIAGEN) from three biological replicates of\neach strain cultured under control conditions and in exudates.\nThe quality assessment of the extracted RNA samples was\nperformed with a NanoDrop OneC Spectrophotometer (Thermo\nFisher Scientific) and a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies)\nand revealed A260/A280 and A260/A230 values of > 2.0 and a mean\nRNA integrity numbers (RIN) value of > 9.2.\nThree biological replicates of RNA samples were shipped on\ndry ice to the DOE Joint Genome Institute (Walnut Creek, CA,\nUnited States), where rRNA was depleted and stranded RNASeq\nlibraries were prepared, quantified by qPCR and sequenced\nusing a HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina). The fastq file reads\nwere filtered and processed with BBDuk1 to remove reads that\ncontained 1 or more “N” bases, had an average quality score\nacross the read less than 10 or had a minimum length < 51 bp\nor 33% of the full read length. Reads mapped with BBMap (see\ntext footnote 2) to masked human, cat, dog, and mouse references\nat 93% identity were removed. Another category of removed\nsequences matched RNA spike-in, PhiX, common microbial\ncontaminants, and ribosomal RNAs. The processed reads from\neach library were aligned to the reference genome using BBMap\nwith only unique mappings allowed (BAMs/directory). If a\nread mapped to more than one location it was ignored.\nfeatureCounts (Liao et al., 2014) was used to generate raw\ngene counts, which were normalized to adjust for the length of\neach gene and total number of reads mapped for each library.\nThe normalization formula used: n = [r/(l/1,000)]/(t/1,000,000),\nwhere n = normalized read count for gene (G) for library (L);\nr = raw read count for gene G for library L; l = gene G length; and\nt = total reads mapped for library L. Raw gene counts were used to\nevaluate the level of correlation between biological samples using\nPearson’s correlation.\nBioinformatic Analysis\nCount tables generated by the JGI RNA-Seq pipeline were input\ninto DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) to normalize and determine\n1https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/\ndifferential expression. Statistical significance was established\nthrough DESeq2 by using three biological replicates for control\nand root exudate conditions. Scatterplots were generated from\nthe DESeq2 data table outputs using ggplot2. Genes differentially\nexpressed between control and root exudate samples (log2 foldchanges\n–2 \u2000 to \u2000 2, adjusted p value \u2000 0.05) were used in\ndownstream analysis. The core genome and pangenome for the\nPseudomonas strains used in this study were computed using the\nOthoMCL v.2.0, Species Tree Builder v.2.2.0, and Phylogenetic\nPangenome Accumulation v1.4.0 apps implemented in the U.S.\nDepartment of Energy Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase)\n(Arkin et al., 2018). Additional comparisons were conducted\nwith the PGAweb pangenome analysis pipeline (Chen et al.,\n2018). Differentially expressed genes were assigned to core,\nnon-core, and singleton parts of each strain’s proteome by\nBLASTp with an E value cutoff of e-06, identity of 40%\nand coverage of 60%. Functional annotation of differentially\nexpressed genes was carried out with the Blast2GO (Conesa\nand Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al.,\n2018). Additional manual curation was performed using tools\nimplemented in the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG)\ndatabase (Markowitz et al., 2012), Pseudomonas Genome\nDatabase (Winsor et al., 2009), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and\nGenomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa et al., 2008), and Geneious 10.2.3\n(Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand). Metabolic functions\nencoded by the differentially expressed genes were mapped\nusing iPath 3.0 (Darzi et al., 2018). Phylogenetic analyses\nwere carried out by building multiple sequence alignments\nwith MAFFT v7.222 (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and inferring\nneighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenies with Geneious Tree Builder.\nThe resultant phylogenetic trees were visualized with iTOL\n(Letunic and Bork, 2016). Reproducibility of clades within the\ninferred NJ trees was assessed by bootstrap resampling with\n1,000 replicates.\nCharacterization of Carbon Source\nUtilization With Biolog Phenotype\nMicroarrays\nThe utilization of carbon sources was analyzed using Phenotype\nMicroArrays (Biolog, Hayward, CA, United States) as follows.\nThe bacteria were cultured overnight on Luria-Bertani agar\nat 25\u2000C, after which cells were harvested and suspended in\ninoculating fluid (IF-0). The transmittance of the suspension\nwas adjusted to 42% using a Biolog turbidimeter. The cell\nsuspension was mixed with IF\U001000000 containing Dye Mix A\n(Biolog) to achieve a final transmittance of 85%. One hundred\nmicroliter aliquots of the adjusted cell suspension were\ninoculated into PM01 and PM02A plates, which were then\nincubated in an OmniLog Phenotype MicroArray System\n(Biolog) at 25\u2000C for 48 h. The formation of formazan was\nrecorded at 15 min intervals, and data were analyzed using\nOmniLog Parametric Analysis software v1.20.02 (Biolog).\nRelative growth of the studied strains was normalized to\ngrowth on D-glucose and visualized using Heatmapper\n(Babicki et al., 2016).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 4 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nData Availability\nSequences generated in this project were deposited\nunder NCBI BioProject accession numbers PRJNA439743\nthrough PRJNA439790.\nRESULTS\nMetabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates\nof B. distachyon\nMetabolomics analysis of lyophilized root exudates revealed\nthe presence of numerous plant metabolites, 86 of which were\nidentified by matching their spectra to the LECO/Fiehn\nMetabolomics library (Supplementary Table 3). These\nmetabolites included (i) carbohydrates and their derivatives\n(glucose, fructose, xylose, sucrose, trehalose, maltose, galactose,\nand others); (ii) sugar alcohols (b-mannosylglycerate, myoinositol,\ngalactinol, 2-deoxyerythritol, ribitol, threitol and\ncellobitol); (iii) amino acids and derivatives (glutamine,\ntyrosine, glutamic acid, asparagine, aspartic acid, valine,\nphenylalanine, isoleucine, glycine, serine, proline, leucine,\ntryptophan, cysteine, methionine, citrulline, and others); (iv)\norganic acids (aconitic, allantoic, g-aminobutyric, azelaic, citric,\nfumaric, 2-furoic, D-glyceric, 3-hydroxypropionic, a-ketoadipic,\nmalic, methylmalonic, nicotinic, quinic, succinic, threonic);\nand (v) assorted metabolites including heterocyclic compounds,\nphenolics, and biogenic amines, etc (3-hydroxypyridine,\nmaleimide, noradrenaline, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoate,\n5-methoxytryptamine, uracil, aminomalonic acid, palmitic acid,\nand urea). Results of the analysis also revealed that root exudates\nof B. distachyon contain hydroxyectoine and the quaternary\namine (QA) glycine betaine (Supplementary Figure 1).\nPhylogenetic and Pangenome Analyses\nof Pseudomonas Strains Used in the\nStudy\nWe used a set of phylogenetic markers suggested by Mulet et al.\n(2010) to investigate the relatedness of the eight strains used in\nthis study to distinct lineages recognized within the P. fluorescens\nspecies complex. The multilocus sequence analysis based on\nthe concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S\nrRNA), gyrB, rpoB, and rpoD identified R1-43-08 (along with\nstrains 2-79 and SBW25) as a member of the P. fluorescens\nsubgroup (Figure 1). The rest of the strains clustered closely with\nfour additional subgroups of the P. fluorescens complex, namely\nP. corrugata (strains Q2-87 and Q8r1-96), P. koreensis (Pf0-1),\nP. protegens (Pf-5), and P. chlororaphis (30–84). The genomes of\nthe eight rhizosphere Pseudomonas strains varied in size by 1.43\nmegabase (ranging from 5.65 to 7.07 Mb) and contained between\n5,166 and 6,363 protein-coding genes (Figure 2A). The shared\ngene content was characterized with OrthoMCL, which uses allagainst-\nall BLASTp followed by the Markov Cluster algorithm to\nidentify protein groups shared between the compared genomes,\nas well as groups representing species-specific gene expansion\nfamilies (Li et al., 2003). The pangenome analysis revealed a\ncore comprised of approximately 3,179 orthologs that were\nshared among all strains and represented 50.0% to 61.5%\nof each predicted proteome (Figures 2A,B). The non-core\npangenome contained genes shared by two or more (but not\nall) strains and contained between 1,482 and 2,080 orthologs,\nwhich corresponded to 28.7–36.3% of individual proteomes. The\nrest of the predicted protein-coding genes were strain-specific\nsingletons that comprised 7.5% to 15.1% of the strain’s predicted\nproteomes. In respect to divergence from the core genome, strain\nPf-5 was found to possess the highest proportion of unique genes\n(n = 949) followed by 2-79 (n = 887). The entire pangenome of\nthe Pseudomonas strains encompassed over 12,000 homolog and\nsingleton gene families.\nFurther homolog family-based comparisons identified Q8r1-\n96 and R1-43-08 as the most distantly related strains, with\n3349 shared homologs (Supplementary Table 4A). Q8r1-96 and\nQ2-87, which shared 4,489 homologs, were the most closely\nrelated strains. The partitioning of homolog gene families into\nthe core, non-core, and singleton parts of the pangenome agreed\nwith phylogenetic relationships of the strains deduced from the\nanalysis of a selected subset of COGs (Clusters of Orthologous\nGroups) (Figure 2C and Supplementary Tables 4B,C). The\nCOG-based phylogeny supported the multilocus sequence\nanalysis and revealed that the eight Pseudomonas strains form\nthree distinct clusters, the first of which contained 2-79, R1-30-\n84, and SBW25. The second cluster included Q8r1-96 and Q2-87,\nwhereas the third encompassed strains 30-84, Pf-5, and Pf0-1.\nCorrelating the Composition of Root\nExudates With Metabolic Profiles of\nPseudomonas Strains\nWe used the Phenotype MicroArray PM1 and PM2 plates to\nprofile the eight Pseudomonas strains for the utilization of\n190 different carbon sources. Results of the analysis identified\n90 compounds that supported growth and clustered by their\nintensities of utilization into three distinct groups (Figure 3).\nGroup I was comprised of 30 highly metabolized carbon\nsources, which included several amino acids and intermediates of\nglycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, and citrate cycle. Approximately\nhalf of these compounds were catabolized by all eight strains,\nand included several organic acids (fumaric, citric, gluconic,\nmalic, and pyroglutamic), amino acids (Glu, Asn, Gln, Asp, Pro,\nAla, and g-aminobutyric acid), carbohydrates (glucose, mannose,\nand mannitol), and the purine nucleoside inosine. Group II\nwas composed of 44 chemically diverse carbon sources that\nwere variably utilized by the strains. These compounds were\ncarbohydrates, organic acids, amino acids, phenolics, and polyols,\nand included known compatible solutes and intermediates of\nmetabolism of pentoses, galactose, starch, and sucrose. Group\nIII encompassed the rest of the Phenotype MicroArray test\npanel and contained compounds that were not catabolized\nby the tested strains. Among several notable exceptions were\na-hydroxyglutamic acid- g-lactone, putrescine, and itaconic,\ncitramalic, and succinamic acids, which supported the growth\nof strains 2-79, 30-84, Pf-5, and SBW25.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nFIGURE 1 | Neighbor joining phylogeny showing the relationship of the eight strains used in this study (indicated by red triangles) to different species of the\nP. fluorescens complex. The phylogeny was established based on the concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S rRNA), gyrB (subunit B of DNA\ngyrase), rpoB (b subunit of RNA polymerase), and rpoD (sigma 70 factor subunit of RNA polymerase). Distance matrices were calculated by the Jukes-Cantor\nmethod. Colored circles on tree nodes indicate bootstrap values (1,000 replicates) that vary between 60% (smallest circle) and 100% (largest circles).\nB. distachyon Bd21. Interestingly, many carbon sources from\nthe Phenotype MicroArray panel were also present in the root\nexudates of B. distachyon Bd21, and some of these compounds\n(glucose, mannose, galactose, fructose, g-aminobutyric acid,\naspartic acid, citric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, quinic acid,\nalanine, glutamine, and glutamic acid) were catabolized by all\nstrains used in this study, while others (e.g., xylose, trehalose,\nm-inositol) were actively utilized only by certain organisms\n(Figure 3). The comparison of catabolic profiles across the\neight studied Pseudomonas strains revealed the presence of three\ndistinct clusters. The first cluster contained strains Q8r1-96 and\nQ2-87, which consumed very similar sets of carbon sources,\nas well as strain Pf0-1. The second cluster was composed of\n2-79, R1-43-08, SBW25, and 30-84, whereas the third cluster\nwas represented by a single strain, Pf-5. The overall similarity\nof the catabolic profiles partially agreed with the separation\nof the strains into different subgroups of the P. fluorescens\ncomplex (see above).\nAnalysis of the RNA-seq Results\nIn order to understand the cellular responses of rhizosphere\nPseudomonas to plant exometabolites, we analyzed the\ntranscriptome changes in cultures grown in the presence of\nroot exudates. Under field conditions, rhizobacteria colonize\nplant roots in the form of surface-attached microaerobic biofilms\n(Hojberg et al., 1999). To mimic these conditions, the eight\nPseudomonas strains were grown statically at 72% air saturation\nin 21C-glucose medium amended with root exudates and then\nprocessed to extract total RNA (Supplementary Figure 2).\nA total of 995 million raw sequencing reads were generated from\nthe RNA samples by using the Illumina HiSeq-2500 platform,\naveraging 20.7 million reads per sample. The removal of lowquality\nand rRNA sequences resulted in a total of 793 million\nfiltered reads that were mapped onto the eight Pseudomonas\ngenomes with a mean of 7.48 million mapped fragments per\ngenome. The differentially abundant transcripts were identified\nby setting a p value of 0.05 (adjusted for multiple testing) and\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 6 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

(B) The gradual expansion of\nthe pangenome (blue color) and contraction of the core genome (green color) following the sequential addition of genomes from the dataset. Box plots indicate the\n25th and 75th percentiles and medians (horizontal lines) with whiskers corresponding to the 10th and 90th percentiles. The input order was randomized to avoid any\nbias due to the sequential addition of new genomes. The pangenome size increases steadily without reaching a plateau even after the addition of 11,939\nnon-redundant gene families. At the same time, the core genome converged to 3,179 genes. (C) The pangenome-based phylogenomic analysis of the studied\nstrains. Here, the pangenome was defined with OrthoMCL, and orthologous gene sets were then partitioned into the core, singleton, and non-core (the remaining\northolog sets) categories. These categories were calculated for each node in the Maximum Likelihood species tree, using the set of genomes for which that node\nrepresents the ancestor. The results of the ortholog partitioning are shown in pie charts placed at tree nodes. Numbers indicate bootstrap support values. The\nanalysis was conducted in KBase (Arkin et al., 2018).\nthe log2 fold-change (FC) threshold \u2000\u2000 2.0 (Figure 4 and\nSupplementary Tables 5–12). When compared with the control\nconditions, an average of 204 genes per strain were differentially\nexpressed in the presence of root exudates, with the highest\n(n = 425) and lowest (n = 112) numbers observed, respectively,\nin SBW25 and Q2-87 (Figure 4). Overall, more genes were\ninduced than repressed in response to exudates, but the actual\nnumbers in each category varied substantially depending on the\nidentity of the Pseudomonas strain. In most strains, the bulk of\nthe differentially expressed genes was almost equally distributed\nbetween the core (mean, 48.2%) and non-core (mean, 45.8%)\nparts of the genome, whereas the strain-specific singleton genes\nconstituted on average only 5.9% (Figure 4B). One notable\nexception was observed in Q8r1-96, where all differentially\nexpressed genes belonged to the core (73.8%) and non-core\n(26.2%) parts of the genome. Another notable pattern was\nobserved in R1-43-08, where the majority of genes affected by\nthe presence of root exudate fell into the non-core category\n(56.3%). The highest proportion of differentially expressed\nsingletons (11.3 and 10.4%, respectively) was identified in\nstrains SBW25 and Pf-5.\nWe further explored how the identified differentially\nexpressed genes were distributed across genomes of the eight\nstudied rhizosphere strains. The pairwise BLASTp comparisons\nidentified 2-79 and SBW25 as two strains that shared the highest\nnumber of genes (n = 101) induced or repressed in response\nto root exudates (Table 1). The second pair of strains with\na significant number of similar differentially expressed genes\n(n = 86) was Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, which was followed by Pf0-1\nand 30-84, which shared 56 differentially expressed genes. These\npatterns of shared genes were also observed when the results of\nthe pairwise BLASTp comparisons were converted into a binary\ngene presence/absence matrix, which was then subjected to\ncluster analysis using a UPGMA algorithm based on Sorensen’s\ndissimilarity index or examined by non-metric multidimensional\nscaling (NMDS) (Figure 5).\nThe differentially expressed Pseudomonas genes were\nsubjected to Blast2Go analysis and Gene Ontology (GO)\nannotation (Figure 6). Metabolic process, catalytic activity,\nand membrane were the most common annotation terms\nacross the three primary GO term categories (i.e., biological\nprocess, molecular function, and cellular component). A total\nof 1,694 GO terms was assigned to 805 upregulated genes, with\nthe majority of the GO terms related to molecular function\n(682, 40.3%), followed by biological process (669, 39.5%), and\ncellular component (343, 20.2%). In the 539 downregulated gene\ncategory, 1,101 GO terms were assigned to biological process\n(420, 38.1%), molecular function (417, 37.9%), and cellular\ncomponent (264, 24.0%). Within biological process, metabolic\nprocess, cellular process, localization, response to stimulus, and\nregulation were over-represented. Within molecular function,\nthe largest proportion was assigned to catalytic activity, binding,\nand transporter activity categories. Within cellular component,\nthe majority were assigned to membrane, membrane part, cell,\nand cell part categories. Across the eight strains, 37–42% of\ndifferentially expressed genes had no Gene Ontology IDs and\nencoded various conserved hypothetical proteins.\nFunctional Classification of Shared\nDifferentially Expressed Genes\nThe interrogation of RNA-seq data revealed multiple cellular\npathways that were differentially regulated in bacterial cultures\nincubated with root exudates (Supplementary Figures 3, 4).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 7 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nFIGURE 3 | Biolog Phenotype MicroArray profiling the eight rhizosphere\nPseudomonas strains used in the study. The hierarchical clustering analysis\nwas carried out using the average linkage method with Euclidean distances.\nCarbon sources identified by red arrowheads were also detected in the sterile\nroot exudates of B. distachyon Bd21.\nAlthough none of these differentially regulated pathways were\nshared by all eight strains, the cross-strain comparisons revealed\nseveral types of common and specific transcriptomic responses\nthat were elicited by the presence of plant exometabolites\n(Table 2). The visual representation of core gene expression\npatterns is provided in Supplementary Figure 5, which\nshows heatmaps of expression profiles and p-adj values for\ncore genes shared by the studied strains. The figure is\naccompanied by Supplementary Table 13 that lists predicted\nfunctions of genes constituting the four distinct clusters\nobserved after hierarchical clustering of gene expression\nvalues. The first category of shared differentially expressed\npathways functioned in the uptake and catabolism of selected\ncarbohydrates, quaternary ammonium compounds (QAs), and\nphenolics. All strains except for R1-43-08, responded to root\nexudates by inducing the fructose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate\n(PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTSFru). The\ncomponents of this system are encoded by a conserved\noperon and include the cytoplasmic polyprotein EI/HPr/EIIAFru\n(FruB), the 1-phosphofructokinase FruK, and the fructosespecific\npermease EIIBC (FruA) (Chavarria et al., 2016). The\nPTSFru system functions by acquiring high-energy phosphates\nfrom PEP and sequentially passing them, via the EI/HPr/EIIAFru\ndomains of FruB, to the EIIB component of FruA. The\nphosphates are ultimately transferred by the EIIC transporter\nto fructose yielding fructose 1-phosphate, which is channeled\ninto the central metabolic pathways through the action of the\nphosphofructokinase FruK.\nIn all strains except for Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, the exposure to root\nexudates resulted in the induction of two genes adjacent to the\nfru cluster that encoded a Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS)\ntransporter and an L-arabinonate dehydratase (Table 2). These\ngenes are predicted to participate in the uptake and catabolism\nof L-arabinose, where L-arabinonate dehydratase plays an\nimportant role by converting L-arabinonate to 2-dehydro-3-\ndeoxy-L-arabinonate (Rahman et al., 2017). In SBW25, R1-\n43-08, and Q2-87, we also observed the induction of genes\nencoding components of the AraFGH complex, an ATP-Binding\nCassette (ABC) superfamily transporter involved in the import of\narabinose into the cell (Supplementary Tables 6, 7, 9). Finally, all\nstrains except SBW25 and R1-43-08 responded to the presence\nof exudates by upregulating a conserved gene encoding an\naldose epimerase superfamily protein. Such enzymes equilibrate\nalpha- and beta-anomers of aldoses and ensure that stereospecific\nenzymes involved in the metabolism of free sugars do not act as\nmetabolic bottlenecks (Abayakoon et al., 2018). Although some\naldose epimerases have been linked to specific pathways, the\nPseudomonas gene identified in this study could not be assigned\nto a particular metabolic process based on sequence analysis and\ngenomic location.\nSeveral Pseudomonas strains responded to the presence\nof root exudates by upregulating genes involved in the\nuptake and catabolism of myo-inositol and possibly other\nstereoisomers of inositol (Table 2). The upregulated catabolic\ngenes encode the dehydrogenase IolG, which oxidizes myoinositol\nto its corresponding ketone, as well as IolE, IolD, IolB,\nand IolC that collectively convert the 2-keto-myo-inositol to\nacetyl-CoA and the glycolysis intermediate dihydroxyacetone\nphosphate (Yoshida et al., 2008; Kohler et al., 2011).

The cross-genome comparisons revealed\nthat in all studied strains except for Pf0-1, components\nof the myo-inositol utilization pathway were encoded\nwithin a well-conserved gene cluster which, in addition to\ncatabolic and transport functions, also encodes a dedicated\ntranscriptional repressor.\nAll studied strains of Pseudomonas carry multiple genes\ninvolved in scavenging the quaternary ammonium compounds\ncholine, glycine betaine (GB), carnitine, choline-O-sulfate, and\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 9 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

Many of these genes were\ndifferentially expressed, including those encoding parts of the\nABC transporter CbcXWV, which is predicted to function in\nthe uptake of choline under water-replete conditions (Table 2).\nAmong enzymes induced in the presence of root exudates were\nthe choline dehydrogenase BetA, which converts choline to\nglycine betaine and a network of enzymes (i.e., the Rieske family\noxygenase GbcAB, the dimethyglycine demethylase DgcAB, and\nthe sarcosine oxidase SoxBDAG) that sequentially convert GB\nto glycine. In 2-79 and SBW25, this group of differentially\nregulated genes also included an AraC-family transcriptional\nactivator GbdR, which perceives intercellular levels of GB and\ninduces genes involved in the transport and catabolism of\nglycine betaine and detoxification of the catabolic byproducts\n(Hampel et al., 2014).\nThe last category of activated catabolic pathways included the\ncatechol branch of the b-ketoadipate pathway for the degradation\nof aromatic compounds. In strains 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5,\ngrowth on root exudates resulted in upregulation of catechol-\n1,2-dioxygenase, muconate cycloisomerase, and muconolactone\nisomerase, which collectively cleave the catechol ring and\nconvert it to b-ketoadipate enol-lactone (Harwood and Parales,\n1996). Finally, analysis of the P. synxantha 2-79 transcriptome\nidentified an induction of benABC genes encoding subunits\nof benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase, an oxidoreductase that generates\ncatechol from benzoate.\nIn addition to various catabolic pathways, the exposure to root\nexudates also induced several genes involved in the homeostasis\nof copper (Table 2). Four of these genes form a conserved cluster\nin genomes of the strains and encode the periplasmic coppersensing\ntwo-component system CinRS, the plastocyanin/azurinlike\nprotein CinA, and the NADPH-dependent pre-Q0 reductase\nCinQ. Also, in strains Q2-87, 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, we observed\nupregulation of a conserved operon encoding the multicopper\noxidase CopA, the periplasmic copper-binding protein CopC, the\ninner membrane protein CopD, and outer membrane protein\nCopB. In several Gram-negative bacteria, these Cop proteins are\nthought to have dual functions and participate both in the uptake\nof essential copper as well as in the sequestration of excess copper\nin the periplasm and outer membrane.\nThe analysis of shared downregulated pathways revealed that\nmost of the strains respond to the presence of root exudates by\nrepressing genes involved in the uptake and catabolism of sulfur\ncompounds (Table 2). In strains SBW25, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96,\nQ2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, this response involved the ssuEADCB\noperon responsible for the utilization of alkanesulfonates\nas sulfur sources. The ssu operon is highly conserved in\nfluorescent pseudomonads and encodes the FMNH2-dependent\nmonooxygenase SsuD and the NAD (P)H-dependent FMN\nreductase SsuE, which together catalyze the desulfonation of\nalkanesulfonates. Also, the ssu locus contains genes for the\nmolybdopterin-binding protein SsuF and the alkanesulfonatespecific\nABC-type transporter consisting of the sulfonate\nsubstrate-binding protein SsuA, sulfonate permease protein\nSsuC, and sulfonate transport ATP-binding protein SsuB. Finally,\nin R1-43-08, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, growth on root exudates\ncoincided with repression of the tauABCD operon, which\nallows these strains to utilize taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonate)\nas a sulfur source. The repressed tau genes encoded the\n2-oxoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenase TauD and\nsubstrate-binding, ATP-binding, and permease components of\nthe taurine-specific ABC transporter TauABC.\nOther Differentially Expressed Pathways\nIn addition to their effect on several shared cellular pathways,\ngrowth on root exudates resulted in the induction or repression of\nnumerous strain-specific genes. In closely related P. synxantha 2-\n79 and P. fluorescens SBW25, we observed differential expression\nof genes involved in energy metabolism, transport of amino\nacids, and surface attachment (Supplementary Tables 5, 6).\nOther notable differentially expressed pathways included 2–\n79 gene clusters that encode enzymes for the catabolism of\ntrehalose, a prophage, and toxin/antitoxin system, as well as the\nSBW25 operon predicted to control the synthesis of the capsular\nexopolysaccharide colonic acid. The response of Pseudomonas sp.\nR1-43-08 to root exudates also involved differential expression\nof different energy metabolism pathways. In addition, we\nobserved the upregulation of genes involved in the uptake and\ncatabolism of xylose (also upregulated in 2–79) and repression\nof enzymes for the biosynthesis of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid\nand assimilation of inorganic sulfur and L-cysteine biosynthesis\n(Supplementary Table 7).\nThe analysis of the Q8r1-96 transcriptome revealed\nperturbation of different metabolic pathways including genes\nencoding components of cytochrome C oxidase, transport\nand catabolism of sorbitol/mannitol, metabolism of butanoic\nacid, and biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides alginate and\npoly-b-1-6-N-acetylglucosamine (Supplementary Table 8). In\nP. fluorescens Q2-87, we identified differential expression of\ngenes involved in metabolism of galactose, tryptophan, tyrosine,\nglycine, serine, and threonine (Supplementary Table 9),\nwhile in P. chlororaphis 30-84, growth on exudates activated\nthe biosynthesis of molybdopterin cofactor, catabolism of\ngalactonate and acetoin, and uptake and catabolism of putrescine\n(Supplementary Table 10). The response of P. protegens Pf-5 to\nroot exudates involved upregulation of acetoin dehydrogenase,\nwhich converts acetoin to acetaldehyde and acetyl-CoA, as\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 10 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

The terms were derived from 93 different functional groups (GO subcategories level 4). The GO terms were assigned with Blast2GO (Conesa\nand Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al., 2018). On a WEGO histogram, the percentage of 100 is defined as the total number of genes assigned a GO\nterm. However, the subcategories do not add up to 100% because many genes fall into more than one functional class and are therefore annotated by multiple GO\nterms.\nwell as pathways for the utilization of glycolate and putrescine\n(Supplementary Table 11). Also induced were genes for\nthe production of pyrrolnitrin and PhlG hydrolase, which\nmodulate the metabolic loads attributed to the synthesis of\n2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol. The differentially expressed genes of\nP. fluorescens Pf0-1 included, among others, operons encoding\ncytochrome C oxidase and enzymes for catabolism of malonic\nacid (Supplementary Table 12). Yet another interesting\nfinding involved the induction of assorted genes acting in the\nhomeostasis of iron and defense against reactive oxygen species\n(ROS). We observed activation of iron dicitrate transporters\n(SBW25 and 30-84), genes for the biosynthesis of siderophores\nornicorrugatin (SBW25) and pyochelin (Pf-5), heme-degrading\nenzymes (2–79, 30–84), TonB siderophore receptors, and\ncomponents of the energy-transducing inner membrane\ncomplex TonB-ExbB-ExbD (2–79 and Pf-5). The differentially\nexpressed ROS defense pathways were represented by different\ncatalases in strains 2–79, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and\nPf-5 and organic hydroperoxide resistance proteins in strains\nSBW25 and R1-43-08.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nsoil microorganisms. Our results were in agreement with a\nrecent report of 27 different sugars, amino acids, and organic\nacids in Brachypodium exudates (Kawasaki et al., 2016). We\nconfirmed the presence of exometabolites identified in that\nstudy, along with dozens of additional analytes that were\nidentified by matching their mass-spectra and retention indices\nto the LECO/Fiehn Metabolomics library (Supplementary\nTable 3). The complementation of the metabolomic analysis\nwith profiling of the bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays\nrevealed that a substantial proportion of the characterized\nexudate constituents were catabolized by a collection of eight\nPseudomonas strains from across the P. fluorescens group that is\nknown to form associations with plant roots. The amendment\nof Pseudomonas cultures with root exudates caused changes in\nthe expression of multiple genes encoding catabolic and anabolic\nenzymes, predicted transporters, transcriptional regulators, stress\nresponse, and conserved hypothetical proteins. In most strains,\nthese differentially expressed genes were almost equally split\nbetween the core and variable genome regions, mirroring\nthe substantial strain-to-strain variation in the genome size\nand gene content within the P. fluorescens species complex\n(Loper et al., 2012).\nThe analysis of transcriptome responses to root exudates\nrevealed several types of cellular pathways present in the strains\nused in this study. The first category of such pathways was\ninvolved in the catabolism of carbohydrates such as fructose,\narabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, trehalose, and galactose. Among\nthese catabolic traits, the ability to utilize fructose as a carbon\nsource is highly conserved among fluorescent pseudomonads.\nIn contrast, growth on arabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, and\ntrehalose is variably present and was traditionally used to\ndifferentiate species and biovars within the P. fluorescens\ngroup (Barrett et al., 1986). We speculate that such variably\ndistributed pathways contribute to the differential affinity of\npseudomonads toward host plants and/or to determine which\nstrains flourish in response to growing roots and changing\nenvironments. Several independent studies have confirmed\nthe importance of carbohydrate catabolism pathways for the\nbiology of rhizosphere pseudomonads. For example, in vivo\nexpression technology (IVET) profiling of P. fluorescens SBW25\nidentified xylose isomerase among genome regions essential\nfor the colonization of sugar beet seedlings (Liu et al., 2015),\nwhereas a genome-wide Tn-Seq screen of Pseudomonas simiae\nidentified genes for the catabolism of myo-inositol among traits\nessential for the colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana roots\n(Cole et al., 2017).\nThe response of rhizosphere Pseudomonas to Brachypodium\nroot exudates also involved pathways for the uptake and\nmetabolism of amino acids. We observed differential\nexpression of genes encoding the hydrophobic (HAAT) and\npolar (PAAT) amino acid uptake transporters in strains\n2-79, SBW25, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5. Other related genes\nencoded enzymes for the catabolism of valine and glutamic\nacid (2-79); metabolism of tryptophan, glycine, serine, and\nthreonine (Q2-87); and biosynthesis of methionine (Q8r1-\n96). It is plausible that the abundance of amino acids in\nroot exudates is also linked to the repression of pathways\ninvolved in the catabolism of sulfonates and taurine that\nwas observed in several strains (Table 2). Although the\npreferred source of sulfur for P. fluorescens is unknown, in the\nclosely related P. aeruginosa, the sulfur starvation response\nis triggered by the growth on any sulfur compound other\nthan sulfate, thiocyanate, and cysteine (Hummerjohann et al.,\n1998). This fact, together with the presence of cysteine and\ncystine in the root exudates, suggest that root exudates of\nBrachypodium may serve as an important source of sulfur for\nrhizosphere Pseudomonas. These findings also agree well with\nthe reported scarcity of inorganic sulfate in the soil, and the\npresence of sulfur mostly in the form of organic compounds,\nincluding amino acids, proteins, sulfate esters, and sulfonates\n(Autry and Fitzgerald, 1990).\nAnother interesting result of this study was the concerted\nactivation of copper and iron homeostasis pathways observed\nin all of the Pseudomonas strains used in this work. In bacteria,\nan excess of copper is toxic and triggers oxidative stress due to\nthe formation of free radicals, as well as disruption of protein\nmetalation and stability of iron-sulfur clusters (Bondarczuk\nand Piotrowska-Seget, 2013). On the other hand, copper is an\nessential trace element used as a cofactor in different enzymes.\nSimilarly, although elevated levels of iron cause redox stress, this\nelement is also found in active energy metabolism enzymes and is\ncrucial for bacterial growth (Andrews et al., 2003). The analysis\nof metal homeostasis genes identified in this study suggests\nthat their induction was likely triggered by the deficiency of\ncopper and iron in bacterial cultures grown in the presence of\nroot exudates. We attribute this effect to the ability of some\ncomponents of root exudates to chelate soil metals.\nDespite the abundance of iron in the soil, its bioavailability\nis limited due to the low solubility of Fe (III) oxyhydrates\nat neutral pH. The non-graminaceous plants circumvent this\nproblem by acidifying the rhizosphere and secreting flavins,\nphenolics, and organic acids that chelate iron. The reduction\nof these ferric chelates releases soluble ferrous iron taken up\nby root cells (Kobayashi and Nishizawa, 2012). Graminaceous\nplants, like Brachypodium, acquire iron by secreting into the\nsoil non-protein amino acids of the mugineic acid (MA) group,\nwhich act as Fe (III)-chelating phytosiderophores. In addition to\niron, low-molecular-weight organic acids and phytosiderophores\nbind other divalent and trivalent metals (including copper) and\ncontribute to heavy-metal tolerance in plants (Chen et al., 2017).\nIt is plausible that the presence of these plant exometabolites\nis responsible for the deficit of iron and copper observed in\nPseudomonas cultures grown in the presence of root exudates.\nThese results further underscore the importance of diverse and\nredundant metal homeostasis pathways found in genomes of the\nP. fluorescens group for the ability of these organisms to colonize\nand persist in the plant rhizosphere.\nRecently, Klonowska et al. (2018) examined transcriptomic\nresponses of symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria to root\nexudates of the legume plant Mimosa pundica, which has\nan unusual ability to support both alpha- (Rhizobium) and\nbeta-rhizobia (Cupriavidus and Burkholderia). Using RNA-seq,\nthe authors characterized genes involved in the perception of\nroot exudates in the nodulating bacteria Burkholderia phymatum\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 14 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nSTM815, Cupriavidus taiwanensis LMG19424, and Rhizobium\nmesoamericanum STM3625. Interestingly, the analysis of\ndifferentially expressed genes revealed induction of pathways\ninvolved in the catabolism of fructose, xylose, myo-inositol,\nand protocatechuate/catechol. Also upregulated were some\ncopper homeostasis, siderophore biosynthesis, and oxidative\nstress genes. Finally, the analytical profiling of M. pundica\nexudates revealed an overlap with Brachypodium in the types of\ncarbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids present. These\nfindings suggest that differentially expressed genes shared by\nmultiple strains of the group P. fluorescens are not unique to\nthe Brachypodium-Pseudomonas system but represent a set\nof conserved cellular pathways involved in the perception of\nplant exometabolites by different clades of rhizosphere-dwelling\nProteobacteria.\nMost strains included in this study were originally selected\nbased on the ability to colonize the rhizosphere and produce\nsecondary metabolites that alleviate the plant stress response\nand/or inhibit soilborne pathogens. It has been suggested\nthat plant metabolites released into the rhizosphere affect\nthe biocontrol activity of plant-beneficial pseudomonads (de\nWerra et al., 2011). We provide further support to this\nhypothesis by demonstrating that in some strains, root exudates\nmodulate the expression of genes for the catabolism of\nthe plant growth-promoting metabolites acetoin and 2,3-\nbutanediol. The exposure to exudates also affected the expression\nof genes for the synthesis of well-characterized antifungal\ncompounds pyrrolnitrin, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, and 2,4-\ndiacetylphloroglucinol. The modulatory effects were strainspecific,\nsuggesting significant differences in the regulatory\nnetworks involved in the perception of plant signals and\nregulation of the production of antibiotics and growthpromoting\nmetabolites.\nThe final significant finding of this study was the induction\nof catabolism of quaternary amines (QAs) observed in multiple\nstrains of the P. fluorescens group during growth on root\nexudates. This observation was supported by the detection of\nglycine betaine in the root secretions of B. distachyon. The\npresence of QAs in plant tissues and the capacity of these\nmetabolites to provide stress protection and nutrients to plant\npathogens and symbionts were reported before (Boncompagni\net al., 1999; Chen et al., 2013; Kabbadj et al., 2017), but our\nstudy is among the first to highlight the potential importance of\nthese metabolites for rhizosphere interactions. Pseudomonads do\nnot synthesize QAs de novo but have evolved many pathways to\nscavenge them from eukaryotic hosts, where these metabolites\nare abundant due to the prominence of phosphatidylcholine\nin cellular membranes. Strains of P. fluorescens carry genes\nfor the conversion of choline, carnitine, and glycine betaine to\nglycine, as well as quaternary amine transporters of the BCCT\nand ABC families that are also conserved in the opportunistic\nhuman pathogen P. aeruginosa and the plant pathogen P. syringae\n(Galvao et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2013; Wargo, 2013b).\nIn P. aeruginosa, choline catabolism genes are essential for\nthe ability of this pathogen to persist during lung infection\n(Wargo, 2013a). Similarly, a P. syringae mutant deficient in\nBetT, OpuC, and CbcXWV quaternary amine transporters had\nreduced fitness during colonization of bean and soybean leaves\nunder greenhouse and field conditions (Chen et al., 2013).\nDepending on water availability, P. aeruginosa and P. syringae\ncatabolize exogenously supplied QAs as carbon and nitrogen\nsources or accumulate them as osmoprotectants (Chen et al.,\n2013; Wargo, 2013b). Our ongoing work in P. synxantha 2–\n79 unraveled similar physiological responses and demonstrated\nthat QA transporters function differentially and redundantly\nin the uptake of quaternary amines as nutrients (Pablo and\nMavrodi, unpublished). In contrast, under water stress, the QAs\ncholine, betaine, and carnitine are accumulated preferentially for\nosmoprotection. Under drought stress, a 2–79 mutant devoid\nof all known QA transporters was less competitive in the\ncolonization of the Brachypodium rhizosphere than its wild-type\nparental strain. Interestingly, our metabolomic profiling of root\nexudates also revealed proline, glutamine, and hydroxyectoine.\nThese metabolites act as compatible solutes in different groups\nof microorganisms (Yancey et al., 1982; Empadinhas and da\nCosta, 2008), suggesting an important role of root exudates\nin the ability of Pseudomonas to persist in the rhizosphere of\ndrought-stressed plants.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe original contributions presented in the study are publicly\navailable.

Plant roots secrete carbon-rich rhizodeposits containing primary and\nsecondary low molecular weight metabolites, lysates, and mucilages. These exudates\nprovide nutrients for soil microorganisms and modulate their affinity to host plants, but\nmolecular details of this process are largely unresolved. We addressed this gap by\nfocusing on the molecular dialog between eight well-characterized beneficial strains\nof the Pseudomonas fluorescens group and Brachypodium distachyon, a model for\neconomically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops of the grass family. We\ncollected and analyzed root exudates of B. distachyon and demonstrated the presence\nof multiple carbohydrates, amino acids, organic acids, and phenolic compounds. The\nsubsequent screening of bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays revealed that many\nof these metabolites provide carbon and energy for the Pseudomonas strains. RNAseq\nprofiling of bacterial cultures amended with root exudates revealed changes in the\nexpression of genes encoding numerous catabolic and anabolic enzymes, transporters,\ntranscriptional regulators, stress response, and conserved hypothetical proteins. Almost\nhalf of the differentially expressed genes mapped to the variable part of the strains’\npangenome, reflecting the importance of the variable gene content in the adaptation of\nP. fluorescens to the rhizosphere lifestyle. Our results collectively reveal the diversity\nof cellular pathways and physiological responses underlying the establishment of\nmutualistic interactions between these beneficial rhizobacteria and their plant hosts.\nKeywords: Pseudomonas, Brachypodium, rhizosphere, root exudates, transcriptome\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 1 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nINTRODUCTION\nPlants are meta-organisms or holobionts that rely in part on\ntheir microbiome for specific functions and traits. The ability\nof the plant microbiome to influence plant development, vigor,\nhealth, and fitness in response to abiotic stressors associated\nwith global climate change is documented by numerous studies\n(Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009). There is mounting evidence\nthat plants actively recruit beneficial microbiomes, but many\naspects of this process are still very much a black box (Reinhold-\nHurek et al., 2015). The foundation for the differential affinity\nof rhizobacteria toward host plants is built upon complex\nchemical cross talk between microorganisms and plant roots.\nUp to 40% of photosynthetically fixed carbon is released by\nplant roots in the form of exudates and secretions, lysates, and\nmucilages (Curl and Truelove, 1986; Lynch, 1990; Whipps, 1990;\nBadri and Vivanco, 2009). The release of these compounds is\nactively controlled in response to environmental stimuli, and the\ncomposition of root exudates varies greatly according to plant\nspecies and physiological condition (Lynch, 1990; Nguyen, 2003;\nPhillips et al., 2004; De-la-Pena et al., 2008). The presence and\ncomposition of exudates strongly impact soil microorganisms,\nwhich is consistent with the idea that plants actively select and\nshape their root microbiota (Zolla et al., 2013).\nPrimary root exudates include simple and complex sugars,\namino acids, polypeptides and proteins, organic, aliphatic and\nfatty acids, sterols, and phenolics (Nguyen, 2003; Badri and\nVivanco, 2009; Badri et al., 2009). These compounds serve as\ncarbon and energy sources for rhizobacteria, and the presence\nof the intact corresponding catabolic pathways is essential\nfor competitive colonization of roots and disease suppression\n(Lugtenberg et al., 2001; Kamilova et al., 2005; Lugtenberg and\nKamilova, 2009). Root exudates also contain numerous signal\nmolecules and secondary metabolites, the significance of which\nis only now emerging (Walker et al., 2003; Bais et al., 2005,\n2006). A handful of analyses of plant-induced gene expression\nby transcriptional profiling in vitro (Mark et al., 2005) or in\nthe rhizosphere (Silby and Levy, 2004; Ramos-Gonzalez et al.,\n2005; Matilla et al., 2007; Barret et al., 2009) have identified\nmultiple genes that are differentially regulated by exposure to\nroots or root exudates. Bacterial pathways expressed during\nrhizosphere colonization control utilization of plant-derived\nmetabolites (Simons et al., 1996, 1997; Camacho-Carvajal, 2001;\nLugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), motility and chemotaxis (de\nWeert et al., 2002; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), phase\nvariation (Dekkers et al., 1998; Sanchez-Contreras et al., 2002;\nvan den Broek et al., 2005), outer membrane integrity (de Weert\net al., 2006; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), and the ability\nto sequester limiting resources (Raaijmakers et al., 1995) and\nresist environmental stresses (Sarniguet et al., 1995; Miller and\nWood, 1996; van Veen et al., 1997; Schnider-Keel et al., 2001). In\nits spatial and temporal properties, root colonization resembles\nbiofilm formation, and biofilm-related pathways also have been\nimplicated in adhesion to seeds and roots and rhizosphere\ncolonization (Espinosa-Urgel et al., 2000; Hinsa et al., 2003;\nYousef-Coronado et al., 2008; Fuqua, 2010; Martinez-Gil et al.,\n2010; Nielsen et al., 2011; Zboralski and Filion, 2020). Finally,\nroot exudates strongly affect the expression of diverse plant\ngrowth promotion and biocontrol genes (Vacheron et al., 2013).\nOver the past decade, the genomes of numerous rhizosphere\nstrains have been sequenced and analyzed, but functional\ngenomics studies of rhizosphere competence lag behind the\navailability of sequence data.\nThis study explored the molecular dialog between the\nmodel host plant Brachypodium distachyon and several wellcharacterized\nrhizosphere strains of the Pseudomonas fluorescens\ngroup. Brachypodium is a small annual grass originating in semiarid\nregions of the Middle East that has emerged as a prime model\nfor economically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops\nof the grass family (Bevan et al., 2010; Schwartz et al., 2010;\nBrkljacic et al., 2011; Hong et al., 2011; Tyler et al., 2014). The\nbiology, extensive collection of resources, and research tools\nmake B. distachyon an attractive model to investigate interactions\nbetween plants and root-associated microbes. Pseudomonads\nare ubiquitous Gram-negative g-proteobacteria that colonize\neukaryotic hosts and include both commensals and economically\nimportant pathogens of plants and animals (Moore et al.,\n2006; Schroth et al., 2006; Yahr and Parsek, 2006). The genus\nPseudomonas currently comprises > 100 named species that have\nbeen separated based on multilocus sequence analysis into 14\nspecies groups (Garrido-Sanz et al., 2016; Hesse et al., 2018).\nThe P. fluorescens group is the most diverse regarding both\nthe genetic distances within it, the number of species and the\nlarge pangenome that makes up > 50% of the pangenome\nof the genus as a whole (Loper et al., 2012). The group also\nencompasses an unusually high proportion of strains that inhabit\nthe plant rhizosphere and possess plant growth promoting and\nbiocontrol properties. Naylor et al. (2017) profiled bacterial\ncommunities associated with root tissues and rhizosphere of\n18 different plant species of the Poaceae family. That study\nidentified Pseudomonas among taxa constituting the core grass\nroot microbiome and demonstrated that these bacteria were\nenriched in C3 plants, including wheat, rye, barley, oat, and\nBrachypodium. We confirmed the capacity of B. distachyon\nBd21 to serve as a host for rhizobacteria of the P. fluorescens\ngroup in preliminary greenhouse assays with biocontrol strains\nP. synxantha 2-79, P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96, and P. protegens\nPf-5. Results of these experiments revealed that all strains\nsuccessfully established and colonized the roots of Brachypodium\n(Supplementary Table 1).\nIn this study, we focused on eight well-studied strains\nof the P. fluorescens complex that are supported by years\nof studies, numerous refereed publications, and high-quality\ngenome sequences. By profiling transcriptomes of these strains\nduring growth in root exudates of B. distachyon, we revealed the\ndiversity of cellular pathways and physiological responses that\nunderlie the establishment of mutualistic interactions between\nbeneficial rhizobacteria and the host plant. Our results also\nconfirmed that root exudates contain carbohydrates, amino acids,\norganic acids, and phenolics that serve as carbon and energy\nsources for rhizobacteria. The root exudates also contained\nosmoprotectants that may help microorganisms to persist in the\nrhizosphere of drought-stressed plants.

R1-43-08 (Parejko\net al., 2012), P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96 (Raaijmakers and Weller,\n1998), P. fluorescens Q2-87 (Bangera and Thomashow, 1996),\nP. chlororaphis 30-84 (Thomashow et al., 1990), P. fluorescens\nPf0-1 (Silby et al., 2009), and P. protegens Pf-5 (Howell and\nStipanovic, 1980). The selected organisms have been studied\nextensively for their role in biological control and plant\ngrowth promotion (Supplementary Table 2). The strains were\nmaintained in the laboratory as frozen stocks (\U0010000080\u2000C) and\nroutinely cultured in King’s medium B (King et al., 1954) or\n21C medium, which contained (per 1 L): 1.0 g of NH4Cl, 3.5 g\nof Na2HPO4\u20002H2O, 2.8 g of KH2PO4, 3.0 g of glucose, and\n20 ml of a microelement solution (Smibert and Kreig, 1994;\nHalverson and Firestone, 2000).\nPropagation of Plants and Collection of\nRoot Exudates\nB. distachyon Bd21 was established from seed material obtained\nfrom the USDA-ARS Plant Germplasm Introduction and Testing\nResearch Unit (Pullman, WA, United States). Brachypodium\nseeds were imbibed for 3 days at 4\u2000C and sown in 7 \u2000 7 cm\npots filled with Sunshine Potting Mix #4 (Sun Gro Horticulture,\nAgawam, MA, United States). Plants were grown in an IR-\n89X (Percival Scientific, Perry, IA, United States) controlled\nenvironment chamber retrofitted with 6500K and 3000K T5 54W\ngrow lights (Spectralux) under a 20-h light, 24\u2000C/4-h dark, 18\u2000C\ncycle. Plants were watered and fertilized with Jack’s professional\nwater-soluble fertilizer (20:20:20) (JR Peters, Allentown, PA,\nUnited States). After 12 weeks and plant senescence, seeds\nwere collected, processed, and stored under desiccant and dark\nconditions at room temperature.\nTo collect root exudates, seeds of B. distachyon Bd21 were\nsurface-sterilized, pregerminated, and placed in sterile 1 L widemouth\nglass jars containing 113 g of 6-mm glass beads and\n25 ml distilled water. Jars were covered with vented caps\nand plants were grown hydroponically in an environmental\ncontrolled growth chamber under conditions described above.\nAfter 6 days, root exudates were extracted from individual\njars and their sterility was confirmed by spotting on nutrient\nagar. Multiple batches of root exudates were collected, filtered\n(0.22 mm), aliquoted in Falcon tubes (10 ml), lyophilized, and\nstored at –80\u2000C.\nMetabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates\nExudates were analyzed for primary metabolites at the Murdock\nMetabolomics Laboratory at Washington State University\n(Pullman, WA, United States). Freeze-dried residues were\nsuspended in 500 ml 50% aqueous acetonitrile and clarified by\ncentrifugation for 20 min at 21,000 \u2000 g and 4\u2000C. The liquid\nchromatography mass spectrometry analysis was conducted\nwith a Synapt G2-S quadrupole-ion mobility spectrometrytime\nof flight mass spectrometer system equipped with an\nacquity ultra-performance liquid chromatograph (UPLC) and\nan acquity photodiode array detector (all from Waters, Milford,\nMA, United States). The exudate metabolites were separated\non a SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC HPLC column (2.1 \u2000 100 mm,\n3 mm) (Milllipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, United States) using\nacetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid as solvent B and water\nwith 0.1% formic acid as solvent A at a flow rate of 400 ml\nmin\U001000001 and the following linear gradient extending over 14 min:\n0 min, 80% B; 4 min, 80% B, 6 min: 10% B; 7.5 min, 10%\nB; 10 min, 80% B; and 14 min, 80% B. Mass spectra were\ncollected in positive ion mode over a range of m/z 50–1,200\nwith a scan time of 0.2 s. The Q-TOF-MS source was at\n3.0 kV and 120\u2000C; the sampling cone at 40 V, desolvation\ntemperature was 250\u2000C; cone gas and desolvation gas flow were\nat 0 and 850 L h\U001000001, respectively. Leucine enkephalin was used\nfor post-acquisition mass correction. Target compounds were\nvisualized using selected ion chromatograms at 0.05 Da window\nwidth. The compound identification was based on comparison\nof chromatographic behavior and accurate masses to those of\nauthentic standards.\nFor gas chromatography, derivatization was carried out using\na modification of the procedure of Lee and Fiehn (2008).\nThe freeze-dried residues were suspended in 950 ml aqueous\nmethanol (84%, v/v) and clarified by centrifugation for 15 min\nat 21,000 \u2000 g at 4\u2000C. The supernatants were spiked with 1\nmg of the internal standard salicylic acid-d6 (C/D/N Isotopes,\nQuebec, Canada) and dried in vacuo. The dry residues were\nsuspended in 10 ml of O-methoxylamine hydrochloride (30 mg\nml\U001000001 in anhydrous pyridine, both from Millipore Sigma) and\nincubated while mixing (1,000 RPM) for 90 min at 30\u2000C.\nSubsequently, samples were derivatized with 90 ml of MSTFA\nwith 1% TMCS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,\nUnited States) for 30 min at 37\u2000C. Gas chromatography-mass\nspectroscopy analysis was performed using a Pegasus 4D timeof-\nflight mass spectrometer (LECO, Saint Joseph MI) equipped\nwith a MPS2 autosampler (Gerstel, Linthicum, MD) and a 7890A\noven (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States).\nThe derivatization products were separated on a 30-m, 0.25 mm\ni.d., 0.25 mm df Rxi-5Sil column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA,\nUnited States) with an IntegraGuard precolumn using ultrapure\nHe at a constant flow of 0.9 ml min\U001000001 as carrier gas. The linear\nthermal gradient started with a 1-min hold at 70\u2000C, followed\nby a ramp to 300\u2000C at 10\u2000C min\U001000001. The final temperature was\nheld for 5 min prior to returning to initial conditions. Mass\nspectra were collected at 17 spectra s\U001000001. Peak identification was\nconducted using the Fiehn primary metabolite library (Kind\net al., 2009) and an identity score cutoff of 700. Additionally,\nauthentic standards for a number of primary metabolites were\nanalyzed under identical conditions and the data used to compare\nthe chromatographic behavior. Peak alignment and spectrum\ncomparisons were carried out using the Statistical Compare\nfeature of ChromaTOF software (LECO).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 3 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nIsolation of RNA From Bacteria Cultured\nin Root Exudates and RNA-Seq\nThe strains were pregrown overnight at 25\u2000C on 21C-glucose\nagar and then subcultured into 96-well microplates containing\nliquid 21C-glucose medium amended with Brachypodium\nexudates. The liquid medium was prepared by dissolving the\nlyophilized root exudate material in an appropriate volume of\n21C-glucose medium to concentrate root exudates 20-fold. The\ngrowth medium was sterilized by passing it through a 0.22-\nmm membrane filter. The control cultures were grown under\nidentical conditions in the absence of exudates. All treatments\nwere inoculated at OD600 of 0.1 and incubated for 20 to\n22 h until cultures entered late-exponential growth phase at\n25\u2000C in an atmosphere of 15% oxygen [created by a ProOx\nP110 oxygen controller (BioSpherix, Parish, NY, United States)\nwith a hypoxia C-chamber]. The cells were stabilized by the\naddition RNAprotect reagent (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD,\nUnited States) and total RNA was purified using a RNeasy Protect\nBacteria Mini Kit (QIAGEN) from three biological replicates of\neach strain cultured under control conditions and in exudates.\nThe quality assessment of the extracted RNA samples was\nperformed with a NanoDrop OneC Spectrophotometer (Thermo\nFisher Scientific) and a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies)\nand revealed A260/A280 and A260/A230 values of > 2.0 and a mean\nRNA integrity numbers (RIN) value of > 9.2.\nThree biological replicates of RNA samples were shipped on\ndry ice to the DOE Joint Genome Institute (Walnut Creek, CA,\nUnited States), where rRNA was depleted and stranded RNASeq\nlibraries were prepared, quantified by qPCR and sequenced\nusing a HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina). The fastq file reads\nwere filtered and processed with BBDuk1 to remove reads that\ncontained 1 or more “N” bases, had an average quality score\nacross the read less than 10 or had a minimum length < 51 bp\nor 33% of the full read length. Reads mapped with BBMap (see\ntext footnote 2) to masked human, cat, dog, and mouse references\nat 93% identity were removed. Another category of removed\nsequences matched RNA spike-in, PhiX, common microbial\ncontaminants, and ribosomal RNAs. The processed reads from\neach library were aligned to the reference genome using BBMap\nwith only unique mappings allowed (BAMs/directory). If a\nread mapped to more than one location it was ignored.\nfeatureCounts (Liao et al., 2014) was used to generate raw\ngene counts, which were normalized to adjust for the length of\neach gene and total number of reads mapped for each library.\nThe normalization formula used: n = [r/(l/1,000)]/(t/1,000,000),\nwhere n = normalized read count for gene (G) for library (L);\nr = raw read count for gene G for library L; l = gene G length; and\nt = total reads mapped for library L. Raw gene counts were used to\nevaluate the level of correlation between biological samples using\nPearson’s correlation.\nBioinformatic Analysis\nCount tables generated by the JGI RNA-Seq pipeline were input\ninto DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) to normalize and determine\n1https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/\ndifferential expression. Statistical significance was established\nthrough DESeq2 by using three biological replicates for control\nand root exudate conditions. Scatterplots were generated from\nthe DESeq2 data table outputs using ggplot2. Genes differentially\nexpressed between control and root exudate samples (log2 foldchanges\n–2 \u2000 to \u2000 2, adjusted p value \u2000 0.05) were used in\ndownstream analysis. The core genome and pangenome for the\nPseudomonas strains used in this study were computed using the\nOthoMCL v.2.0, Species Tree Builder v.2.2.0, and Phylogenetic\nPangenome Accumulation v1.4.0 apps implemented in the U.S.\nDepartment of Energy Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase)\n(Arkin et al., 2018). Additional comparisons were conducted\nwith the PGAweb pangenome analysis pipeline (Chen et al.,\n2018). Differentially expressed genes were assigned to core,\nnon-core, and singleton parts of each strain’s proteome by\nBLASTp with an E value cutoff of e-06, identity of 40%\nand coverage of 60%. Functional annotation of differentially\nexpressed genes was carried out with the Blast2GO (Conesa\nand Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al.,\n2018). Additional manual curation was performed using tools\nimplemented in the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG)\ndatabase (Markowitz et al., 2012), Pseudomonas Genome\nDatabase (Winsor et al., 2009), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and\nGenomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa et al., 2008), and Geneious 10.2.3\n(Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand). Metabolic functions\nencoded by the differentially expressed genes were mapped\nusing iPath 3.0 (Darzi et al., 2018). Phylogenetic analyses\nwere carried out by building multiple sequence alignments\nwith MAFFT v7.222 (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and inferring\nneighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenies with Geneious Tree Builder.\nThe resultant phylogenetic trees were visualized with iTOL\n(Letunic and Bork, 2016). Reproducibility of clades within the\ninferred NJ trees was assessed by bootstrap resampling with\n1,000 replicates.\nCharacterization of Carbon Source\nUtilization With Biolog Phenotype\nMicroarrays\nThe utilization of carbon sources was analyzed using Phenotype\nMicroArrays (Biolog, Hayward, CA, United States) as follows.\nThe bacteria were cultured overnight on Luria-Bertani agar\nat 25\u2000C, after which cells were harvested and suspended in\ninoculating fluid (IF-0). The transmittance of the suspension\nwas adjusted to 42% using a Biolog turbidimeter. The cell\nsuspension was mixed with IF\U001000000 containing Dye Mix A\n(Biolog) to achieve a final transmittance of 85%. One hundred\nmicroliter aliquots of the adjusted cell suspension were\ninoculated into PM01 and PM02A plates, which were then\nincubated in an OmniLog Phenotype MicroArray System\n(Biolog) at 25\u2000C for 48 h. The formation of formazan was\nrecorded at 15 min intervals, and data were analyzed using\nOmniLog Parametric Analysis software v1.20.02 (Biolog).\nRelative growth of the studied strains was normalized to\ngrowth on D-glucose and visualized using Heatmapper\n(Babicki et al., 2016).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 4 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nData Availability\nSequences generated in this project were deposited\nunder NCBI BioProject accession numbers PRJNA439743\nthrough PRJNA439790.\nRESULTS\nMetabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates\nof B. distachyon\nMetabolomics analysis of lyophilized root exudates revealed\nthe presence of numerous plant metabolites, 86 of which were\nidentified by matching their spectra to the LECO/Fiehn\nMetabolomics library (Supplementary Table 3). These\nmetabolites included (i) carbohydrates and their derivatives\n(glucose, fructose, xylose, sucrose, trehalose, maltose, galactose,\nand others); (ii) sugar alcohols (b-mannosylglycerate, myoinositol,\ngalactinol, 2-deoxyerythritol, ribitol, threitol and\ncellobitol); (iii) amino acids and derivatives (glutamine,\ntyrosine, glutamic acid, asparagine, aspartic acid, valine,\nphenylalanine, isoleucine, glycine, serine, proline, leucine,\ntryptophan, cysteine, methionine, citrulline, and others); (iv)\norganic acids (aconitic, allantoic, g-aminobutyric, azelaic, citric,\nfumaric, 2-furoic, D-glyceric, 3-hydroxypropionic, a-ketoadipic,\nmalic, methylmalonic, nicotinic, quinic, succinic, threonic);\nand (v) assorted metabolites including heterocyclic compounds,\nphenolics, and biogenic amines, etc (3-hydroxypyridine,\nmaleimide, noradrenaline, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoate,\n5-methoxytryptamine, uracil, aminomalonic acid, palmitic acid,\nand urea). Results of the analysis also revealed that root exudates\nof B. distachyon contain hydroxyectoine and the quaternary\namine (QA) glycine betaine (Supplementary Figure 1).\nPhylogenetic and Pangenome Analyses\nof Pseudomonas Strains Used in the\nStudy\nWe used a set of phylogenetic markers suggested by Mulet et al.\n(2010) to investigate the relatedness of the eight strains used in\nthis study to distinct lineages recognized within the P. fluorescens\nspecies complex. The multilocus sequence analysis based on\nthe concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S\nrRNA), gyrB, rpoB, and rpoD identified R1-43-08 (along with\nstrains 2-79 and SBW25) as a member of the P. fluorescens\nsubgroup (Figure 1). The rest of the strains clustered closely with\nfour additional subgroups of the P. fluorescens complex, namely\nP. corrugata (strains Q2-87 and Q8r1-96), P. koreensis (Pf0-1),\nP. protegens (Pf-5), and P. chlororaphis (30–84). The genomes of\nthe eight rhizosphere Pseudomonas strains varied in size by 1.43\nmegabase (ranging from 5.65 to 7.07 Mb) and contained between\n5,166 and 6,363 protein-coding genes (Figure 2A). The shared\ngene content was characterized with OrthoMCL, which uses allagainst-\nall BLASTp followed by the Markov Cluster algorithm to\nidentify protein groups shared between the compared genomes,\nas well as groups representing species-specific gene expansion\nfamilies (Li et al., 2003). The pangenome analysis revealed a\ncore comprised of approximately 3,179 orthologs that were\nshared among all strains and represented 50.0% to 61.5%\nof each predicted proteome (Figures 2A,B). The non-core\npangenome contained genes shared by two or more (but not\nall) strains and contained between 1,482 and 2,080 orthologs,\nwhich corresponded to 28.7–36.3% of individual proteomes. The\nrest of the predicted protein-coding genes were strain-specific\nsingletons that comprised 7.5% to 15.1% of the strain’s predicted\nproteomes. In respect to divergence from the core genome, strain\nPf-5 was found to possess the highest proportion of unique genes\n(n = 949) followed by 2-79 (n = 887). The entire pangenome of\nthe Pseudomonas strains encompassed over 12,000 homolog and\nsingleton gene families.\nFurther homolog family-based comparisons identified Q8r1-\n96 and R1-43-08 as the most distantly related strains, with\n3349 shared homologs (Supplementary Table 4A). Q8r1-96 and\nQ2-87, which shared 4,489 homologs, were the most closely\nrelated strains. The partitioning of homolog gene families into\nthe core, non-core, and singleton parts of the pangenome agreed\nwith phylogenetic relationships of the strains deduced from the\nanalysis of a selected subset of COGs (Clusters of Orthologous\nGroups) (Figure 2C and Supplementary Tables 4B,C). The\nCOG-based phylogeny supported the multilocus sequence\nanalysis and revealed that the eight Pseudomonas strains form\nthree distinct clusters, the first of which contained 2-79, R1-30-\n84, and SBW25. The second cluster included Q8r1-96 and Q2-87,\nwhereas the third encompassed strains 30-84, Pf-5, and Pf0-1.\nCorrelating the Composition of Root\nExudates With Metabolic Profiles of\nPseudomonas Strains\nWe used the Phenotype MicroArray PM1 and PM2 plates to\nprofile the eight Pseudomonas strains for the utilization of\n190 different carbon sources. Results of the analysis identified\n90 compounds that supported growth and clustered by their\nintensities of utilization into three distinct groups (Figure 3).\nGroup I was comprised of 30 highly metabolized carbon\nsources, which included several amino acids and intermediates of\nglycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, and citrate cycle. Approximately\nhalf of these compounds were catabolized by all eight strains,\nand included several organic acids (fumaric, citric, gluconic,\nmalic, and pyroglutamic), amino acids (Glu, Asn, Gln, Asp, Pro,\nAla, and g-aminobutyric acid), carbohydrates (glucose, mannose,\nand mannitol), and the purine nucleoside inosine. Group II\nwas composed of 44 chemically diverse carbon sources that\nwere variably utilized by the strains. These compounds were\ncarbohydrates, organic acids, amino acids, phenolics, and polyols,\nand included known compatible solutes and intermediates of\nmetabolism of pentoses, galactose, starch, and sucrose. Group\nIII encompassed the rest of the Phenotype MicroArray test\npanel and contained compounds that were not catabolized\nby the tested strains. Among several notable exceptions were\na-hydroxyglutamic acid- g-lactone, putrescine, and itaconic,\ncitramalic, and succinamic acids, which supported the growth\nof strains 2-79, 30-84, Pf-5, and SBW25. We further matched\nthe carbon metabolic profiles of the Pseudomonas strains against\nthe list of plant-derived metabolites from the root exudates of\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 5 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nFIGURE 1 | Neighbor joining phylogeny showing the relationship of the eight strains used in this study (indicated by red triangles) to different species of the\nP. fluorescens complex. The phylogeny was established based on the concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S rRNA), gyrB (subunit B of DNA\ngyrase), rpoB (b subunit of RNA polymerase), and rpoD (sigma 70 factor subunit of RNA polymerase). Distance matrices were calculated by the Jukes-Cantor\nmethod. Colored circles on tree nodes indicate bootstrap values (1,000 replicates) that vary between 60% (smallest circle) and 100% (largest circles).\nB. distachyon Bd21. Interestingly, many carbon sources from\nthe Phenotype MicroArray panel were also present in the root\nexudates of B. distachyon Bd21, and some of these compounds\n(glucose, mannose, galactose, fructose, g-aminobutyric acid,\naspartic acid, citric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, quinic acid,\nalanine, glutamine, and glutamic acid) were catabolized by all\nstrains used in this study, while others (e.g., xylose, trehalose,\nm-inositol) were actively utilized only by certain organisms\n(Figure 3). The comparison of catabolic profiles across the\neight studied Pseudomonas strains revealed the presence of three\ndistinct clusters. The first cluster contained strains Q8r1-96 and\nQ2-87, which consumed very similar sets of carbon sources,\nas well as strain Pf0-1. The second cluster was composed of\n2-79, R1-43-08, SBW25, and 30-84, whereas the third cluster\nwas represented by a single strain, Pf-5. The overall similarity\nof the catabolic profiles partially agreed with the separation\nof the strains into different subgroups of the P. fluorescens\ncomplex (see above).\nAnalysis of the RNA-seq Results\nIn order to understand the cellular responses of rhizosphere\nPseudomonas to plant exometabolites, we analyzed the\ntranscriptome changes in cultures grown in the presence of\nroot exudates. Under field conditions, rhizobacteria colonize\nplant roots in the form of surface-attached microaerobic biofilms\n(Hojberg et al., 1999). To mimic these conditions, the eight\nPseudomonas strains were grown statically at 72% air saturation\nin 21C-glucose medium amended with root exudates and then\nprocessed to extract total RNA (Supplementary Figure 2).\nA total of 995 million raw sequencing reads were generated from\nthe RNA samples by using the Illumina HiSeq-2500 platform,\naveraging 20.7 million reads per sample. The removal of lowquality\nand rRNA sequences resulted in a total of 793 million\nfiltered reads that were mapped onto the eight Pseudomonas\ngenomes with a mean of 7.48 million mapped fragments per\ngenome. The differentially abundant transcripts were identified\nby setting a p value of 0.05 (adjusted for multiple testing) and\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 6 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

(B) The gradual expansion of\nthe pangenome (blue color) and contraction of the core genome (green color) following the sequential addition of genomes from the dataset. Box plots indicate the\n25th and 75th percentiles and medians (horizontal lines) with whiskers corresponding to the 10th and 90th percentiles. The input order was randomized to avoid any\nbias due to the sequential addition of new genomes. The pangenome size increases steadily without reaching a plateau even after the addition of 11,939\nnon-redundant gene families. At the same time, the core genome converged to 3,179 genes. (C) The pangenome-based phylogenomic analysis of the studied\nstrains. Here, the pangenome was defined with OrthoMCL, and orthologous gene sets were then partitioned into the core, singleton, and non-core (the remaining\northolog sets) categories. These categories were calculated for each node in the Maximum Likelihood species tree, using the set of genomes for which that node\nrepresents the ancestor. The results of the ortholog partitioning are shown in pie charts placed at tree nodes. Numbers indicate bootstrap support values. The\nanalysis was conducted in KBase (Arkin et al., 2018).\nthe log2 fold-change (FC) threshold \u2000\u2000 2.0 (Figure 4 and\nSupplementary Tables 5–12). When compared with the control\nconditions, an average of 204 genes per strain were differentially\nexpressed in the presence of root exudates, with the highest\n(n = 425) and lowest (n = 112) numbers observed, respectively,\nin SBW25 and Q2-87 (Figure 4). Overall, more genes were\ninduced than repressed in response to exudates, but the actual\nnumbers in each category varied substantially depending on the\nidentity of the Pseudomonas strain. In most strains, the bulk of\nthe differentially expressed genes was almost equally distributed\nbetween the core (mean, 48.2%) and non-core (mean, 45.8%)\nparts of the genome, whereas the strain-specific singleton genes\nconstituted on average only 5.9% (Figure 4B). One notable\nexception was observed in Q8r1-96, where all differentially\nexpressed genes belonged to the core (73.8%) and non-core\n(26.2%) parts of the genome. Another notable pattern was\nobserved in R1-43-08, where the majority of genes affected by\nthe presence of root exudate fell into the non-core category\n(56.3%). The highest proportion of differentially expressed\nsingletons (11.3 and 10.4%, respectively) was identified in\nstrains SBW25 and Pf-5.\nWe further explored how the identified differentially\nexpressed genes were distributed across genomes of the eight\nstudied rhizosphere strains. The pairwise BLASTp comparisons\nidentified 2-79 and SBW25 as two strains that shared the highest\nnumber of genes (n = 101) induced or repressed in response\nto root exudates (Table 1). The second pair of strains with\na significant number of similar differentially expressed genes\n(n = 86) was Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, which was followed by Pf0-1\nand 30-84, which shared 56 differentially expressed genes. These\npatterns of shared genes were also observed when the results of\nthe pairwise BLASTp comparisons were converted into a binary\ngene presence/absence matrix, which was then subjected to\ncluster analysis using a UPGMA algorithm based on Sorensen’s\ndissimilarity index or examined by non-metric multidimensional\nscaling (NMDS) (Figure 5).\nThe differentially expressed Pseudomonas genes were\nsubjected to Blast2Go analysis and Gene Ontology (GO)\nannotation (Figure 6). Metabolic process, catalytic activity,\nand membrane were the most common annotation terms\nacross the three primary GO term categories (i.e., biological\nprocess, molecular function, and cellular component). A total\nof 1,694 GO terms was assigned to 805 upregulated genes, with\nthe majority of the GO terms related to molecular function\n(682, 40.3%), followed by biological process (669, 39.5%), and\ncellular component (343, 20.2%). In the 539 downregulated gene\ncategory, 1,101 GO terms were assigned to biological process\n(420, 38.1%), molecular function (417, 37.9%), and cellular\ncomponent (264, 24.0%). Within biological process, metabolic\nprocess, cellular process, localization, response to stimulus, and\nregulation were over-represented. Within molecular function,\nthe largest proportion was assigned to catalytic activity, binding,\nand transporter activity categories. Within cellular component,\nthe majority were assigned to membrane, membrane part, cell,\nand cell part categories. Across the eight strains, 37–42% of\ndifferentially expressed genes had no Gene Ontology IDs and\nencoded various conserved hypothetical proteins.\nFunctional Classification of Shared\nDifferentially Expressed Genes\nThe interrogation of RNA-seq data revealed multiple cellular\npathways that were differentially regulated in bacterial cultures\nincubated with root exudates (Supplementary Figures 3, 4).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 7 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

The hierarchical clustering analysis\nwas carried out using the average linkage method with Euclidean distances.\nCarbon sources identified by red arrowheads were also detected in the sterile\nroot exudates of B. distachyon Bd21.\nAlthough none of these differentially regulated pathways were\nshared by all eight strains, the cross-strain comparisons revealed\nseveral types of common and specific transcriptomic responses\nthat were elicited by the presence of plant exometabolites\n(Table 2). The visual representation of core gene expression\npatterns is provided in Supplementary Figure 5, which\nshows heatmaps of expression profiles and p-adj values for\ncore genes shared by the studied strains. The figure is\naccompanied by Supplementary Table 13 that lists predicted\nfunctions of genes constituting the four distinct clusters\nobserved after hierarchical clustering of gene expression\nvalues. The first category of shared differentially expressed\npathways functioned in the uptake and catabolism of selected\ncarbohydrates, quaternary ammonium compounds (QAs), and\nphenolics. All strains except for R1-43-08, responded to root\nexudates by inducing the fructose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate\n(PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTSFru). The\ncomponents of this system are encoded by a conserved\noperon and include the cytoplasmic polyprotein EI/HPr/EIIAFru\n(FruB), the 1-phosphofructokinase FruK, and the fructosespecific\npermease EIIBC (FruA) (Chavarria et al., 2016). The\nPTSFru system functions by acquiring high-energy phosphates\nfrom PEP and sequentially passing them, via the EI/HPr/EIIAFru\ndomains of FruB, to the EIIB component of FruA. The\nphosphates are ultimately transferred by the EIIC transporter\nto fructose yielding fructose 1-phosphate, which is channeled\ninto the central metabolic pathways through the action of the\nphosphofructokinase FruK.\nIn all strains except for Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, the exposure to root\nexudates resulted in the induction of two genes adjacent to the\nfru cluster that encoded a Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS)\ntransporter and an L-arabinonate dehydratase (Table 2). These\ngenes are predicted to participate in the uptake and catabolism\nof L-arabinose, where L-arabinonate dehydratase plays an\nimportant role by converting L-arabinonate to 2-dehydro-3-\ndeoxy-L-arabinonate (Rahman et al., 2017). In SBW25, R1-\n43-08, and Q2-87, we also observed the induction of genes\nencoding components of the AraFGH complex, an ATP-Binding\nCassette (ABC) superfamily transporter involved in the import of\narabinose into the cell (Supplementary Tables 6, 7, 9). Finally, all\nstrains except SBW25 and R1-43-08 responded to the presence\nof exudates by upregulating a conserved gene encoding an\naldose epimerase superfamily protein. Such enzymes equilibrate\nalpha- and beta-anomers of aldoses and ensure that stereospecific\nenzymes involved in the metabolism of free sugars do not act as\nmetabolic bottlenecks (Abayakoon et al., 2018). Although some\naldose epimerases have been linked to specific pathways, the\nPseudomonas gene identified in this study could not be assigned\nto a particular metabolic process based on sequence analysis and\ngenomic location.\nSeveral Pseudomonas strains responded to the presence\nof root exudates by upregulating genes involved in the\nuptake and catabolism of myo-inositol and possibly other\nstereoisomers of inositol (Table 2). The upregulated catabolic\ngenes encode the dehydrogenase IolG, which oxidizes myoinositol\nto its corresponding ketone, as well as IolE, IolD, IolB,\nand IolC that collectively convert the 2-keto-myo-inositol to\nacetyl-CoA and the glycolysis intermediate dihydroxyacetone\nphosphate (Yoshida et al., 2008; Kohler et al., 2011). In R1-\n43-08, Q8r1-96, Q2-87, and Pf-5, the upregulated functions\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 8 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

The cross-genome comparisons revealed\nthat in all studied strains except for Pf0-1, components\nof the myo-inositol utilization pathway were encoded\nwithin a well-conserved gene cluster which, in addition to\ncatabolic and transport functions, also encodes a dedicated\ntranscriptional repressor.\nAll studied strains of Pseudomonas carry multiple genes\ninvolved in scavenging the quaternary ammonium compounds\ncholine, glycine betaine (GB), carnitine, choline-O-sulfate, and\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 9 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

Many of these genes were\ndifferentially expressed, including those encoding parts of the\nABC transporter CbcXWV, which is predicted to function in\nthe uptake of choline under water-replete conditions (Table 2).\nAmong enzymes induced in the presence of root exudates were\nthe choline dehydrogenase BetA, which converts choline to\nglycine betaine and a network of enzymes (i.e., the Rieske family\noxygenase GbcAB, the dimethyglycine demethylase DgcAB, and\nthe sarcosine oxidase SoxBDAG) that sequentially convert GB\nto glycine. In 2-79 and SBW25, this group of differentially\nregulated genes also included an AraC-family transcriptional\nactivator GbdR, which perceives intercellular levels of GB and\ninduces genes involved in the transport and catabolism of\nglycine betaine and detoxification of the catabolic byproducts\n(Hampel et al., 2014).\nThe last category of activated catabolic pathways included the\ncatechol branch of the b-ketoadipate pathway for the degradation\nof aromatic compounds. In strains 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5,\ngrowth on root exudates resulted in upregulation of catechol-\n1,2-dioxygenase, muconate cycloisomerase, and muconolactone\nisomerase, which collectively cleave the catechol ring and\nconvert it to b-ketoadipate enol-lactone (Harwood and Parales,\n1996). Finally, analysis of the P. synxantha 2-79 transcriptome\nidentified an induction of benABC genes encoding subunits\nof benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase, an oxidoreductase that generates\ncatechol from benzoate.\nIn addition to various catabolic pathways, the exposure to root\nexudates also induced several genes involved in the homeostasis\nof copper (Table 2). Four of these genes form a conserved cluster\nin genomes of the strains and encode the periplasmic coppersensing\ntwo-component system CinRS, the plastocyanin/azurinlike\nprotein CinA, and the NADPH-dependent pre-Q0 reductase\nCinQ. Also, in strains Q2-87, 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, we observed\nupregulation of a conserved operon encoding the multicopper\noxidase CopA, the periplasmic copper-binding protein CopC, the\ninner membrane protein CopD, and outer membrane protein\nCopB. In several Gram-negative bacteria, these Cop proteins are\nthought to have dual functions and participate both in the uptake\nof essential copper as well as in the sequestration of excess copper\nin the periplasm and outer membrane.\nThe analysis of shared downregulated pathways revealed that\nmost of the strains respond to the presence of root exudates by\nrepressing genes involved in the uptake and catabolism of sulfur\ncompounds (Table 2). In strains SBW25, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96,\nQ2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, this response involved the ssuEADCB\noperon responsible for the utilization of alkanesulfonates\nas sulfur sources. The ssu operon is highly conserved in\nfluorescent pseudomonads and encodes the FMNH2-dependent\nmonooxygenase SsuD and the NAD (P)H-dependent FMN\nreductase SsuE, which together catalyze the desulfonation of\nalkanesulfonates. Also, the ssu locus contains genes for the\nmolybdopterin-binding protein SsuF and the alkanesulfonatespecific\nABC-type transporter consisting of the sulfonate\nsubstrate-binding protein SsuA, sulfonate permease protein\nSsuC, and sulfonate transport ATP-binding protein SsuB. Finally,\nin R1-43-08, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, growth on root exudates\ncoincided with repression of the tauABCD operon, which\nallows these strains to utilize taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonate)\nas a sulfur source. The repressed tau genes encoded the\n2-oxoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenase TauD and\nsubstrate-binding, ATP-binding, and permease components of\nthe taurine-specific ABC transporter TauABC.\nOther Differentially Expressed Pathways\nIn addition to their effect on several shared cellular pathways,\ngrowth on root exudates resulted in the induction or repression of\nnumerous strain-specific genes. In closely related P. synxantha 2-\n79 and P. fluorescens SBW25, we observed differential expression\nof genes involved in energy metabolism, transport of amino\nacids, and surface attachment (Supplementary Tables 5, 6).\nOther notable differentially expressed pathways included 2–\n79 gene clusters that encode enzymes for the catabolism of\ntrehalose, a prophage, and toxin/antitoxin system, as well as the\nSBW25 operon predicted to control the synthesis of the capsular\nexopolysaccharide colonic acid. The response of Pseudomonas sp.\nR1-43-08 to root exudates also involved differential expression\nof different energy metabolism pathways. In addition, we\nobserved the upregulation of genes involved in the uptake and\ncatabolism of xylose (also upregulated in 2–79) and repression\nof enzymes for the biosynthesis of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid\nand assimilation of inorganic sulfur and L-cysteine biosynthesis\n(Supplementary Table 7).\nThe analysis of the Q8r1-96 transcriptome revealed\nperturbation of different metabolic pathways including genes\nencoding components of cytochrome C oxidase, transport\nand catabolism of sorbitol/mannitol, metabolism of butanoic\nacid, and biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides alginate and\npoly-b-1-6-N-acetylglucosamine (Supplementary Table 8). In\nP. fluorescens Q2-87, we identified differential expression of\ngenes involved in metabolism of galactose, tryptophan, tyrosine,\nglycine, serine, and threonine (Supplementary Table 9),\nwhile in P. chlororaphis 30-84, growth on exudates activated\nthe biosynthesis of molybdopterin cofactor, catabolism of\ngalactonate and acetoin, and uptake and catabolism of putrescine\n(Supplementary Table 10). The response of P. protegens Pf-5 to\nroot exudates involved upregulation of acetoin dehydrogenase,\nwhich converts acetoin to acetaldehyde and acetyl-CoA, as\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 10 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

The terms were derived from 93 different functional groups (GO subcategories level 4). The GO terms were assigned with Blast2GO (Conesa\nand Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al., 2018). On a WEGO histogram, the percentage of 100 is defined as the total number of genes assigned a GO\nterm. However, the subcategories do not add up to 100% because many genes fall into more than one functional class and are therefore annotated by multiple GO\nterms.\nwell as pathways for the utilization of glycolate and putrescine\n(Supplementary Table 11). Also induced were genes for\nthe production of pyrrolnitrin and PhlG hydrolase, which\nmodulate the metabolic loads attributed to the synthesis of\n2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol. The differentially expressed genes of\nP. fluorescens Pf0-1 included, among others, operons encoding\ncytochrome C oxidase and enzymes for catabolism of malonic\nacid (Supplementary Table 12). Yet another interesting\nfinding involved the induction of assorted genes acting in the\nhomeostasis of iron and defense against reactive oxygen species\n(ROS). We observed activation of iron dicitrate transporters\n(SBW25 and 30-84), genes for the biosynthesis of siderophores\nornicorrugatin (SBW25) and pyochelin (Pf-5), heme-degrading\nenzymes (2–79, 30–84), TonB siderophore receptors, and\ncomponents of the energy-transducing inner membrane\ncomplex TonB-ExbB-ExbD (2–79 and Pf-5). The differentially\nexpressed ROS defense pathways were represented by different\ncatalases in strains 2–79, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and\nPf-5 and organic hydroperoxide resistance proteins in strains\nSBW25 and R1-43-08.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nsoil microorganisms. Our results were in agreement with a\nrecent report of 27 different sugars, amino acids, and organic\nacids in Brachypodium exudates (Kawasaki et al., 2016). We\nconfirmed the presence of exometabolites identified in that\nstudy, along with dozens of additional analytes that were\nidentified by matching their mass-spectra and retention indices\nto the LECO/Fiehn Metabolomics library (Supplementary\nTable 3). The complementation of the metabolomic analysis\nwith profiling of the bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays\nrevealed that a substantial proportion of the characterized\nexudate constituents were catabolized by a collection of eight\nPseudomonas strains from across the P. fluorescens group that is\nknown to form associations with plant roots. The amendment\nof Pseudomonas cultures with root exudates caused changes in\nthe expression of multiple genes encoding catabolic and anabolic\nenzymes, predicted transporters, transcriptional regulators, stress\nresponse, and conserved hypothetical proteins. In most strains,\nthese differentially expressed genes were almost equally split\nbetween the core and variable genome regions, mirroring\nthe substantial strain-to-strain variation in the genome size\nand gene content within the P. fluorescens species complex\n(Loper et al., 2012).\nThe analysis of transcriptome responses to root exudates\nrevealed several types of cellular pathways present in the strains\nused in this study. The first category of such pathways was\ninvolved in the catabolism of carbohydrates such as fructose,\narabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, trehalose, and galactose. Among\nthese catabolic traits, the ability to utilize fructose as a carbon\nsource is highly conserved among fluorescent pseudomonads.\nIn contrast, growth on arabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, and\ntrehalose is variably present and was traditionally used to\ndifferentiate species and biovars within the P. fluorescens\ngroup (Barrett et al., 1986). We speculate that such variably\ndistributed pathways contribute to the differential affinity of\npseudomonads toward host plants and/or to determine which\nstrains flourish in response to growing roots and changing\nenvironments. Several independent studies have confirmed\nthe importance of carbohydrate catabolism pathways for the\nbiology of rhizosphere pseudomonads. For example, in vivo\nexpression technology (IVET) profiling of P. fluorescens SBW25\nidentified xylose isomerase among genome regions essential\nfor the colonization of sugar beet seedlings (Liu et al., 2015),\nwhereas a genome-wide Tn-Seq screen of Pseudomonas simiae\nidentified genes for the catabolism of myo-inositol among traits\nessential for the colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana roots\n(Cole et al., 2017).\nThe response of rhizosphere Pseudomonas to Brachypodium\nroot exudates also involved pathways for the uptake and\nmetabolism of amino acids. We observed differential\nexpression of genes encoding the hydrophobic (HAAT) and\npolar (PAAT) amino acid uptake transporters in strains\n2-79, SBW25, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5. Other related genes\nencoded enzymes for the catabolism of valine and glutamic\nacid (2-79); metabolism of tryptophan, glycine, serine, and\nthreonine (Q2-87); and biosynthesis of methionine (Q8r1-\n96). It is plausible that the abundance of amino acids in\nroot exudates is also linked to the repression of pathways\ninvolved in the catabolism of sulfonates and taurine that\nwas observed in several strains (Table 2). Although the\npreferred source of sulfur for P. fluorescens is unknown, in the\nclosely related P. aeruginosa, the sulfur starvation response\nis triggered by the growth on any sulfur compound other\nthan sulfate, thiocyanate, and cysteine (Hummerjohann et al.,\n1998). This fact, together with the presence of cysteine and\ncystine in the root exudates, suggest that root exudates of\nBrachypodium may serve as an important source of sulfur for\nrhizosphere Pseudomonas. These findings also agree well with\nthe reported scarcity of inorganic sulfate in the soil, and the\npresence of sulfur mostly in the form of organic compounds,\nincluding amino acids, proteins, sulfate esters, and sulfonates\n(Autry and Fitzgerald, 1990).\nAnother interesting result of this study was the concerted\nactivation of copper and iron homeostasis pathways observed\nin all of the Pseudomonas strains used in this work. In bacteria,\nan excess of copper is toxic and triggers oxidative stress due to\nthe formation of free radicals, as well as disruption of protein\nmetalation and stability of iron-sulfur clusters (Bondarczuk\nand Piotrowska-Seget, 2013). On the other hand, copper is an\nessential trace element used as a cofactor in different enzymes.\nSimilarly, although elevated levels of iron cause redox stress, this\nelement is also found in active energy metabolism enzymes and is\ncrucial for bacterial growth (Andrews et al., 2003). The analysis\nof metal homeostasis genes identified in this study suggests\nthat their induction was likely triggered by the deficiency of\ncopper and iron in bacterial cultures grown in the presence of\nroot exudates. We attribute this effect to the ability of some\ncomponents of root exudates to chelate soil metals.\nDespite the abundance of iron in the soil, its bioavailability\nis limited due to the low solubility of Fe (III) oxyhydrates\nat neutral pH. The non-graminaceous plants circumvent this\nproblem by acidifying the rhizosphere and secreting flavins,\nphenolics, and organic acids that chelate iron. The reduction\nof these ferric chelates releases soluble ferrous iron taken up\nby root cells (Kobayashi and Nishizawa, 2012). Graminaceous\nplants, like Brachypodium, acquire iron by secreting into the\nsoil non-protein amino acids of the mugineic acid (MA) group,\nwhich act as Fe (III)-chelating phytosiderophores. In addition to\niron, low-molecular-weight organic acids and phytosiderophores\nbind other divalent and trivalent metals (including copper) and\ncontribute to heavy-metal tolerance in plants (Chen et al., 2017).\nIt is plausible that the presence of these plant exometabolites\nis responsible for the deficit of iron and copper observed in\nPseudomonas cultures grown in the presence of root exudates.\nThese results further underscore the importance of diverse and\nredundant metal homeostasis pathways found in genomes of the\nP. fluorescens group for the ability of these organisms to colonize\nand persist in the plant rhizosphere.\nRecently, Klonowska et al. (2018) examined transcriptomic\nresponses of symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria to root\nexudates of the legume plant Mimosa pundica, which has\nan unusual ability to support both alpha- (Rhizobium) and\nbeta-rhizobia (Cupriavidus and Burkholderia). Using RNA-seq,\nthe authors characterized genes involved in the perception of\nroot exudates in the nodulating bacteria Burkholderia phymatum\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 14 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nSTM815, Cupriavidus taiwanensis LMG19424, and Rhizobium\nmesoamericanum STM3625. Interestingly, the analysis of\ndifferentially expressed genes revealed induction of pathways\ninvolved in the catabolism of fructose, xylose, myo-inositol,\nand protocatechuate/catechol. Also upregulated were some\ncopper homeostasis, siderophore biosynthesis, and oxidative\nstress genes. Finally, the analytical profiling of M. pundica\nexudates revealed an overlap with Brachypodium in the types of\ncarbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids present. These\nfindings suggest that differentially expressed genes shared by\nmultiple strains of the group P. fluorescens are not unique to\nthe Brachypodium-Pseudomonas system but represent a set\nof conserved cellular pathways involved in the perception of\nplant exometabolites by different clades of rhizosphere-dwelling\nProteobacteria.\nMost strains included in this study were originally selected\nbased on the ability to colonize the rhizosphere and produce\nsecondary metabolites that alleviate the plant stress response\nand/or inhibit soilborne pathogens. It has been suggested\nthat plant metabolites released into the rhizosphere affect\nthe biocontrol activity of plant-beneficial pseudomonads (de\nWerra et al., 2011). We provide further support to this\nhypothesis by demonstrating that in some strains, root exudates\nmodulate the expression of genes for the catabolism of\nthe plant growth-promoting metabolites acetoin and 2,3-\nbutanediol. The exposure to exudates also affected the expression\nof genes for the synthesis of well-characterized antifungal\ncompounds pyrrolnitrin, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, and 2,4-\ndiacetylphloroglucinol. The modulatory effects were strainspecific,\nsuggesting significant differences in the regulatory\nnetworks involved in the perception of plant signals and\nregulation of the production of antibiotics and growthpromoting\nmetabolites.\nThe final significant finding of this study was the induction\nof catabolism of quaternary amines (QAs) observed in multiple\nstrains of the P. fluorescens group during growth on root\nexudates. This observation was supported by the detection of\nglycine betaine in the root secretions of B. distachyon. The\npresence of QAs in plant tissues and the capacity of these\nmetabolites to provide stress protection and nutrients to plant\npathogens and symbionts were reported before (Boncompagni\net al., 1999; Chen et al., 2013; Kabbadj et al., 2017), but our\nstudy is among the first to highlight the potential importance of\nthese metabolites for rhizosphere interactions. Pseudomonads do\nnot synthesize QAs de novo but have evolved many pathways to\nscavenge them from eukaryotic hosts, where these metabolites\nare abundant due to the prominence of phosphatidylcholine\nin cellular membranes. Strains of P. fluorescens carry genes\nfor the conversion of choline, carnitine, and glycine betaine to\nglycine, as well as quaternary amine transporters of the BCCT\nand ABC families that are also conserved in the opportunistic\nhuman pathogen P. aeruginosa and the plant pathogen P. syringae\n(Galvao et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2013; Wargo, 2013b).\nIn P. aeruginosa, choline catabolism genes are essential for\nthe ability of this pathogen to persist during lung infection\n(Wargo, 2013a). Similarly, a P. syringae mutant deficient in\nBetT, OpuC, and CbcXWV quaternary amine transporters had\nreduced fitness during colonization of bean and soybean leaves\nunder greenhouse and field conditions (Chen et al., 2013).\nDepending on water availability, P. aeruginosa and P. syringae\ncatabolize exogenously supplied QAs as carbon and nitrogen\nsources or accumulate them as osmoprotectants (Chen et al.,\n2013; Wargo, 2013b). Our ongoing work in P. synxantha 2–\n79 unraveled similar physiological responses and demonstrated\nthat QA transporters function differentially and redundantly\nin the uptake of quaternary amines as nutrients (Pablo and\nMavrodi, unpublished). In contrast, under water stress, the QAs\ncholine, betaine, and carnitine are accumulated preferentially for\nosmoprotection. Under drought stress, a 2–79 mutant devoid\nof all known QA transporters was less competitive in the\ncolonization of the Brachypodium rhizosphere than its wild-type\nparental strain. Interestingly, our metabolomic profiling of root\nexudates also revealed proline, glutamine, and hydroxyectoine.\nThese metabolites act as compatible solutes in different groups\nof microorganisms (Yancey et al., 1982; Empadinhas and da\nCosta, 2008), suggesting an important role of root exudates\nin the ability of Pseudomonas to persist in the rhizosphere of\ndrought-stressed plants.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe original contributions presented in the study are publicly\navailable.

Plant roots secrete carbon-rich rhizodeposits containing primary and\nsecondary low molecular weight metabolites, lysates, and mucilages. These exudates\nprovide nutrients for soil microorganisms and modulate their affinity to host plants, but\nmolecular details of this process are largely unresolved. We addressed this gap by\nfocusing on the molecular dialog between eight well-characterized beneficial strains\nof the Pseudomonas fluorescens group and Brachypodium distachyon, a model for\neconomically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops of the grass family. We\ncollected and analyzed root exudates of B. distachyon and demonstrated the presence\nof multiple carbohydrates, amino acids, organic acids, and phenolic compounds. The\nsubsequent screening of bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays revealed that many\nof these metabolites provide carbon and energy for the Pseudomonas strains. RNAseq\nprofiling of bacterial cultures amended with root exudates revealed changes in the\nexpression of genes encoding numerous catabolic and anabolic enzymes, transporters,\ntranscriptional regulators, stress response, and conserved hypothetical proteins. Almost\nhalf of the differentially expressed genes mapped to the variable part of the strains’\npangenome, reflecting the importance of the variable gene content in the adaptation of\nP. fluorescens to the rhizosphere lifestyle. Our results collectively reveal the diversity\nof cellular pathways and physiological responses underlying the establishment of\nmutualistic interactions between these beneficial rhizobacteria and their plant hosts.\nKeywords: Pseudomonas, Brachypodium, rhizosphere, root exudates, transcriptome\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 1 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nINTRODUCTION\nPlants are meta-organisms or holobionts that rely in part on\ntheir microbiome for specific functions and traits. The ability\nof the plant microbiome to influence plant development, vigor,\nhealth, and fitness in response to abiotic stressors associated\nwith global climate change is documented by numerous studies\n(Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009). There is mounting evidence\nthat plants actively recruit beneficial microbiomes, but many\naspects of this process are still very much a black box (Reinhold-\nHurek et al., 2015). The foundation for the differential affinity\nof rhizobacteria toward host plants is built upon complex\nchemical cross talk between microorganisms and plant roots.\nUp to 40% of photosynthetically fixed carbon is released by\nplant roots in the form of exudates and secretions, lysates, and\nmucilages (Curl and Truelove, 1986; Lynch, 1990; Whipps, 1990;\nBadri and Vivanco, 2009). The release of these compounds is\nactively controlled in response to environmental stimuli, and the\ncomposition of root exudates varies greatly according to plant\nspecies and physiological condition (Lynch, 1990; Nguyen, 2003;\nPhillips et al., 2004; De-la-Pena et al., 2008). The presence and\ncomposition of exudates strongly impact soil microorganisms,\nwhich is consistent with the idea that plants actively select and\nshape their root microbiota (Zolla et al., 2013).\nPrimary root exudates include simple and complex sugars,\namino acids, polypeptides and proteins, organic, aliphatic and\nfatty acids, sterols, and phenolics (Nguyen, 2003; Badri and\nVivanco, 2009; Badri et al., 2009). These compounds serve as\ncarbon and energy sources for rhizobacteria, and the presence\nof the intact corresponding catabolic pathways is essential\nfor competitive colonization of roots and disease suppression\n(Lugtenberg et al., 2001; Kamilova et al., 2005; Lugtenberg and\nKamilova, 2009). Root exudates also contain numerous signal\nmolecules and secondary metabolites, the significance of which\nis only now emerging (Walker et al., 2003; Bais et al., 2005,\n2006). A handful of analyses of plant-induced gene expression\nby transcriptional profiling in vitro (Mark et al., 2005) or in\nthe rhizosphere (Silby and Levy, 2004; Ramos-Gonzalez et al.,\n2005; Matilla et al., 2007; Barret et al., 2009) have identified\nmultiple genes that are differentially regulated by exposure to\nroots or root exudates. Bacterial pathways expressed during\nrhizosphere colonization control utilization of plant-derived\nmetabolites (Simons et al., 1996, 1997; Camacho-Carvajal, 2001;\nLugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), motility and chemotaxis (de\nWeert et al., 2002; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), phase\nvariation (Dekkers et al., 1998; Sanchez-Contreras et al., 2002;\nvan den Broek et al., 2005), outer membrane integrity (de Weert\net al., 2006; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), and the ability\nto sequester limiting resources (Raaijmakers et al., 1995) and\nresist environmental stresses (Sarniguet et al., 1995; Miller and\nWood, 1996; van Veen et al., 1997; Schnider-Keel et al., 2001). In\nits spatial and temporal properties, root colonization resembles\nbiofilm formation, and biofilm-related pathways also have been\nimplicated in adhesion to seeds and roots and rhizosphere\ncolonization (Espinosa-Urgel et al., 2000; Hinsa et al., 2003;\nYousef-Coronado et al., 2008; Fuqua, 2010; Martinez-Gil et al.,\n2010; Nielsen et al., 2011; Zboralski and Filion, 2020). Finally,\nroot exudates strongly affect the expression of diverse plant\ngrowth promotion and biocontrol genes (Vacheron et al., 2013).\nOver the past decade, the genomes of numerous rhizosphere\nstrains have been sequenced and analyzed, but functional\ngenomics studies of rhizosphere competence lag behind the\navailability of sequence data.\nThis study explored the molecular dialog between the\nmodel host plant Brachypodium distachyon and several wellcharacterized\nrhizosphere strains of the Pseudomonas fluorescens\ngroup. Brachypodium is a small annual grass originating in semiarid\nregions of the Middle East that has emerged as a prime model\nfor economically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops\nof the grass family (Bevan et al., 2010; Schwartz et al., 2010;\nBrkljacic et al., 2011; Hong et al., 2011; Tyler et al., 2014). The\nbiology, extensive collection of resources, and research tools\nmake B. distachyon an attractive model to investigate interactions\nbetween plants and root-associated microbes. Pseudomonads\nare ubiquitous Gram-negative g-proteobacteria that colonize\neukaryotic hosts and include both commensals and economically\nimportant pathogens of plants and animals (Moore et al.,\n2006; Schroth et al., 2006; Yahr and Parsek, 2006). The genus\nPseudomonas currently comprises > 100 named species that have\nbeen separated based on multilocus sequence analysis into 14\nspecies groups (Garrido-Sanz et al., 2016; Hesse et al., 2018).\nThe P. fluorescens group is the most diverse regarding both\nthe genetic distances within it, the number of species and the\nlarge pangenome that makes up > 50% of the pangenome\nof the genus as a whole (Loper et al., 2012). The group also\nencompasses an unusually high proportion of strains that inhabit\nthe plant rhizosphere and possess plant growth promoting and\nbiocontrol properties. Naylor et al. (2017) profiled bacterial\ncommunities associated with root tissues and rhizosphere of\n18 different plant species of the Poaceae family. That study\nidentified Pseudomonas among taxa constituting the core grass\nroot microbiome and demonstrated that these bacteria were\nenriched in C3 plants, including wheat, rye, barley, oat, and\nBrachypodium. We confirmed the capacity of B. distachyon\nBd21 to serve as a host for rhizobacteria of the P. fluorescens\ngroup in preliminary greenhouse assays with biocontrol strains\nP. synxantha 2-79, P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96, and P. protegens\nPf-5. Results of these experiments revealed that all strains\nsuccessfully established and colonized the roots of Brachypodium\n(Supplementary Table 1).\nIn this study, we focused on eight well-studied strains\nof the P. fluorescens complex that are supported by years\nof studies, numerous refereed publications, and high-quality\ngenome sequences. By profiling transcriptomes of these strains\nduring growth in root exudates of B. distachyon, we revealed the\ndiversity of cellular pathways and physiological responses that\nunderlie the establishment of mutualistic interactions between\nbeneficial rhizobacteria and the host plant. Our results also\nconfirmed that root exudates contain carbohydrates, amino acids,\norganic acids, and phenolics that serve as carbon and energy\nsources for rhizobacteria. The root exudates also contained\nosmoprotectants that may help microorganisms to persist in the\nrhizosphere of drought-stressed plants.

R1-43-08 (Parejko\net al., 2012), P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96 (Raaijmakers and Weller,\n1998), P. fluorescens Q2-87 (Bangera and Thomashow, 1996),\nP. chlororaphis 30-84 (Thomashow et al., 1990), P. fluorescens\nPf0-1 (Silby et al., 2009), and P. protegens Pf-5 (Howell and\nStipanovic, 1980). The selected organisms have been studied\nextensively for their role in biological control and plant\ngrowth promotion (Supplementary Table 2). The strains were\nmaintained in the laboratory as frozen stocks (\U0010000080\u2000C) and\nroutinely cultured in King’s medium B (King et al., 1954) or\n21C medium, which contained (per 1 L): 1.0 g of NH4Cl, 3.5 g\nof Na2HPO4\u20002H2O, 2.8 g of KH2PO4, 3.0 g of glucose, and\n20 ml of a microelement solution (Smibert and Kreig, 1994;\nHalverson and Firestone, 2000).\nPropagation of Plants and Collection of\nRoot Exudates\nB. distachyon Bd21 was established from seed material obtained\nfrom the USDA-ARS Plant Germplasm Introduction and Testing\nResearch Unit (Pullman, WA, United States). Brachypodium\nseeds were imbibed for 3 days at 4\u2000C and sown in 7 \u2000 7 cm\npots filled with Sunshine Potting Mix #4 (Sun Gro Horticulture,\nAgawam, MA, United States). Plants were grown in an IR-\n89X (Percival Scientific, Perry, IA, United States) controlled\nenvironment chamber retrofitted with 6500K and 3000K T5 54W\ngrow lights (Spectralux) under a 20-h light, 24\u2000C/4-h dark, 18\u2000C\ncycle. Plants were watered and fertilized with Jack’s professional\nwater-soluble fertilizer (20:20:20) (JR Peters, Allentown, PA,\nUnited States). After 12 weeks and plant senescence, seeds\nwere collected, processed, and stored under desiccant and dark\nconditions at room temperature.\nTo collect root exudates, seeds of B. distachyon Bd21 were\nsurface-sterilized, pregerminated, and placed in sterile 1 L widemouth\nglass jars containing 113 g of 6-mm glass beads and\n25 ml distilled water. Jars were covered with vented caps\nand plants were grown hydroponically in an environmental\ncontrolled growth chamber under conditions described above.\nAfter 6 days, root exudates were extracted from individual\njars and their sterility was confirmed by spotting on nutrient\nagar. Multiple batches of root exudates were collected, filtered\n(0.22 mm), aliquoted in Falcon tubes (10 ml), lyophilized, and\nstored at –80\u2000C.\nMetabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates\nExudates were analyzed for primary metabolites at the Murdock\nMetabolomics Laboratory at Washington State University\n(Pullman, WA, United States). Freeze-dried residues were\nsuspended in 500 ml 50% aqueous acetonitrile and clarified by\ncentrifugation for 20 min at 21,000 \u2000 g and 4\u2000C. The liquid\nchromatography mass spectrometry analysis was conducted\nwith a Synapt G2-S quadrupole-ion mobility spectrometrytime\nof flight mass spectrometer system equipped with an\nacquity ultra-performance liquid chromatograph (UPLC) and\nan acquity photodiode array detector (all from Waters, Milford,\nMA, United States). The exudate metabolites were separated\non a SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC HPLC column (2.1 \u2000 100 mm,\n3 mm) (Milllipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, United States) using\nacetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid as solvent B and water\nwith 0.1% formic acid as solvent A at a flow rate of 400 ml\nmin\U001000001 and the following linear gradient extending over 14 min:\n0 min, 80% B; 4 min, 80% B, 6 min: 10% B; 7.5 min, 10%\nB; 10 min, 80% B; and 14 min, 80% B. Mass spectra were\ncollected in positive ion mode over a range of m/z 50–1,200\nwith a scan time of 0.2 s. The Q-TOF-MS source was at\n3.0 kV and 120\u2000C; the sampling cone at 40 V, desolvation\ntemperature was 250\u2000C; cone gas and desolvation gas flow were\nat 0 and 850 L h\U001000001, respectively. Leucine enkephalin was used\nfor post-acquisition mass correction. Target compounds were\nvisualized using selected ion chromatograms at 0.05 Da window\nwidth. The compound identification was based on comparison\nof chromatographic behavior and accurate masses to those of\nauthentic standards.\nFor gas chromatography, derivatization was carried out using\na modification of the procedure of Lee and Fiehn (2008).\nThe freeze-dried residues were suspended in 950 ml aqueous\nmethanol (84%, v/v) and clarified by centrifugation for 15 min\nat 21,000 \u2000 g at 4\u2000C. The supernatants were spiked with 1\nmg of the internal standard salicylic acid-d6 (C/D/N Isotopes,\nQuebec, Canada) and dried in vacuo. The dry residues were\nsuspended in 10 ml of O-methoxylamine hydrochloride (30 mg\nml\U001000001 in anhydrous pyridine, both from Millipore Sigma) and\nincubated while mixing (1,000 RPM) for 90 min at 30\u2000C.\nSubsequently, samples were derivatized with 90 ml of MSTFA\nwith 1% TMCS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,\nUnited States) for 30 min at 37\u2000C. Gas chromatography-mass\nspectroscopy analysis was performed using a Pegasus 4D timeof-\nflight mass spectrometer (LECO, Saint Joseph MI) equipped\nwith a MPS2 autosampler (Gerstel, Linthicum, MD) and a 7890A\noven (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States).\nThe derivatization products were separated on a 30-m, 0.25 mm\ni.d., 0.25 mm df Rxi-5Sil column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA,\nUnited States) with an IntegraGuard precolumn using ultrapure\nHe at a constant flow of 0.9 ml min\U001000001 as carrier gas. The linear\nthermal gradient started with a 1-min hold at 70\u2000C, followed\nby a ramp to 300\u2000C at 10\u2000C min\U001000001. The final temperature was\nheld for 5 min prior to returning to initial conditions. Mass\nspectra were collected at 17 spectra s\U001000001. Peak identification was\nconducted using the Fiehn primary metabolite library (Kind\net al., 2009) and an identity score cutoff of 700. Additionally,\nauthentic standards for a number of primary metabolites were\nanalyzed under identical conditions and the data used to compare\nthe chromatographic behavior. Peak alignment and spectrum\ncomparisons were carried out using the Statistical Compare\nfeature of ChromaTOF software (LECO).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 3 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nIsolation of RNA From Bacteria Cultured\nin Root Exudates and RNA-Seq\nThe strains were pregrown overnight at 25\u2000C on 21C-glucose\nagar and then subcultured into 96-well microplates containing\nliquid 21C-glucose medium amended with Brachypodium\nexudates. The liquid medium was prepared by dissolving the\nlyophilized root exudate material in an appropriate volume of\n21C-glucose medium to concentrate root exudates 20-fold. The\ngrowth medium was sterilized by passing it through a 0.22-\nmm membrane filter. The control cultures were grown under\nidentical conditions in the absence of exudates. All treatments\nwere inoculated at OD600 of 0.1 and incubated for 20 to\n22 h until cultures entered late-exponential growth phase at\n25\u2000C in an atmosphere of 15% oxygen [created by a ProOx\nP110 oxygen controller (BioSpherix, Parish, NY, United States)\nwith a hypoxia C-chamber]. The cells were stabilized by the\naddition RNAprotect reagent (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD,\nUnited States) and total RNA was purified using a RNeasy Protect\nBacteria Mini Kit (QIAGEN) from three biological replicates of\neach strain cultured under control conditions and in exudates.\nThe quality assessment of the extracted RNA samples was\nperformed with a NanoDrop OneC Spectrophotometer (Thermo\nFisher Scientific) and a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies)\nand revealed A260/A280 and A260/A230 values of > 2.0 and a mean\nRNA integrity numbers (RIN) value of > 9.2.\nThree biological replicates of RNA samples were shipped on\ndry ice to the DOE Joint Genome Institute (Walnut Creek, CA,\nUnited States), where rRNA was depleted and stranded RNASeq\nlibraries were prepared, quantified by qPCR and sequenced\nusing a HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina). The fastq file reads\nwere filtered and processed with BBDuk1 to remove reads that\ncontained 1 or more “N” bases, had an average quality score\nacross the read less than 10 or had a minimum length < 51 bp\nor 33% of the full read length. Reads mapped with BBMap (see\ntext footnote 2) to masked human, cat, dog, and mouse references\nat 93% identity were removed. Another category of removed\nsequences matched RNA spike-in, PhiX, common microbial\ncontaminants, and ribosomal RNAs. The processed reads from\neach library were aligned to the reference genome using BBMap\nwith only unique mappings allowed (BAMs/directory). If a\nread mapped to more than one location it was ignored.\nfeatureCounts (Liao et al., 2014) was used to generate raw\ngene counts, which were normalized to adjust for the length of\neach gene and total number of reads mapped for each library.\nThe normalization formula used: n = [r/(l/1,000)]/(t/1,000,000),\nwhere n = normalized read count for gene (G) for library (L);\nr = raw read count for gene G for library L; l = gene G length; and\nt = total reads mapped for library L. Raw gene counts were used to\nevaluate the level of correlation between biological samples using\nPearson’s correlation.\nBioinformatic Analysis\nCount tables generated by the JGI RNA-Seq pipeline were input\ninto DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) to normalize and determine\n1https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/\ndifferential expression. Statistical significance was established\nthrough DESeq2 by using three biological replicates for control\nand root exudate conditions. Scatterplots were generated from\nthe DESeq2 data table outputs using ggplot2. Genes differentially\nexpressed between control and root exudate samples (log2 foldchanges\n–2 \u2000 to \u2000 2, adjusted p value \u2000 0.05) were used in\ndownstream analysis. The core genome and pangenome for the\nPseudomonas strains used in this study were computed using the\nOthoMCL v.2.0, Species Tree Builder v.2.2.0, and Phylogenetic\nPangenome Accumulation v1.4.0 apps implemented in the U.S.\nDepartment of Energy Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase)\n(Arkin et al., 2018). Additional comparisons were conducted\nwith the PGAweb pangenome analysis pipeline (Chen et al.,\n2018). Differentially expressed genes were assigned to core,\nnon-core, and singleton parts of each strain’s proteome by\nBLASTp with an E value cutoff of e-06, identity of 40%\nand coverage of 60%. Functional annotation of differentially\nexpressed genes was carried out with the Blast2GO (Conesa\nand Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al.,\n2018). Additional manual curation was performed using tools\nimplemented in the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG)\ndatabase (Markowitz et al., 2012), Pseudomonas Genome\nDatabase (Winsor et al., 2009), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and\nGenomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa et al., 2008), and Geneious 10.2.3\n(Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand). Metabolic functions\nencoded by the differentially expressed genes were mapped\nusing iPath 3.0 (Darzi et al., 2018). Phylogenetic analyses\nwere carried out by building multiple sequence alignments\nwith MAFFT v7.222 (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and inferring\nneighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenies with Geneious Tree Builder.\nThe resultant phylogenetic trees were visualized with iTOL\n(Letunic and Bork, 2016). Reproducibility of clades within the\ninferred NJ trees was assessed by bootstrap resampling with\n1,000 replicates.\nCharacterization of Carbon Source\nUtilization With Biolog Phenotype\nMicroarrays\nThe utilization of carbon sources was analyzed using Phenotype\nMicroArrays (Biolog, Hayward, CA, United States) as follows.\nThe bacteria were cultured overnight on Luria-Bertani agar\nat 25\u2000C, after which cells were harvested and suspended in\ninoculating fluid (IF-0). The transmittance of the suspension\nwas adjusted to 42% using a Biolog turbidimeter. The cell\nsuspension was mixed with IF\U001000000 containing Dye Mix A\n(Biolog) to achieve a final transmittance of 85%. One hundred\nmicroliter aliquots of the adjusted cell suspension were\ninoculated into PM01 and PM02A plates, which were then\nincubated in an OmniLog Phenotype MicroArray System\n(Biolog) at 25\u2000C for 48 h. The formation of formazan was\nrecorded at 15 min intervals, and data were analyzed using\nOmniLog Parametric Analysis software v1.20.02 (Biolog).\nRelative growth of the studied strains was normalized to\ngrowth on D-glucose and visualized using Heatmapper\n(Babicki et al., 2016).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 4 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nData Availability\nSequences generated in this project were deposited\nunder NCBI BioProject accession numbers PRJNA439743\nthrough PRJNA439790.\nRESULTS\nMetabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates\nof B. distachyon\nMetabolomics analysis of lyophilized root exudates revealed\nthe presence of numerous plant metabolites, 86 of which were\nidentified by matching their spectra to the LECO/Fiehn\nMetabolomics library (Supplementary Table 3). These\nmetabolites included (i) carbohydrates and their derivatives\n(glucose, fructose, xylose, sucrose, trehalose, maltose, galactose,\nand others); (ii) sugar alcohols (b-mannosylglycerate, myoinositol,\ngalactinol, 2-deoxyerythritol, ribitol, threitol and\ncellobitol); (iii) amino acids and derivatives (glutamine,\ntyrosine, glutamic acid, asparagine, aspartic acid, valine,\nphenylalanine, isoleucine, glycine, serine, proline, leucine,\ntryptophan, cysteine, methionine, citrulline, and others); (iv)\norganic acids (aconitic, allantoic, g-aminobutyric, azelaic, citric,\nfumaric, 2-furoic, D-glyceric, 3-hydroxypropionic, a-ketoadipic,\nmalic, methylmalonic, nicotinic, quinic, succinic, threonic);\nand (v) assorted metabolites including heterocyclic compounds,\nphenolics, and biogenic amines, etc (3-hydroxypyridine,\nmaleimide, noradrenaline, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoate,\n5-methoxytryptamine, uracil, aminomalonic acid, palmitic acid,\nand urea). Results of the analysis also revealed that root exudates\nof B. distachyon contain hydroxyectoine and the quaternary\namine (QA) glycine betaine (Supplementary Figure 1).\nPhylogenetic and Pangenome Analyses\nof Pseudomonas Strains Used in the\nStudy\nWe used a set of phylogenetic markers suggested by Mulet et al.\n(2010) to investigate the relatedness of the eight strains used in\nthis study to distinct lineages recognized within the P. fluorescens\nspecies complex. The multilocus sequence analysis based on\nthe concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S\nrRNA), gyrB, rpoB, and rpoD identified R1-43-08 (along with\nstrains 2-79 and SBW25) as a member of the P. fluorescens\nsubgroup (Figure 1). The rest of the strains clustered closely with\nfour additional subgroups of the P. fluorescens complex, namely\nP. corrugata (strains Q2-87 and Q8r1-96), P. koreensis (Pf0-1),\nP. protegens (Pf-5), and P. chlororaphis (30–84). The genomes of\nthe eight rhizosphere Pseudomonas strains varied in size by 1.43\nmegabase (ranging from 5.65 to 7.07 Mb) and contained between\n5,166 and 6,363 protein-coding genes (Figure 2A). The shared\ngene content was characterized with OrthoMCL, which uses allagainst-\nall BLASTp followed by the Markov Cluster algorithm to\nidentify protein groups shared between the compared genomes,\nas well as groups representing species-specific gene expansion\nfamilies (Li et al., 2003). The pangenome analysis revealed a\ncore comprised of approximately 3,179 orthologs that were\nshared among all strains and represented 50.0% to 61.5%\nof each predicted proteome (Figures 2A,B). The non-core\npangenome contained genes shared by two or more (but not\nall) strains and contained between 1,482 and 2,080 orthologs,\nwhich corresponded to 28.7–36.3% of individual proteomes. The\nrest of the predicted protein-coding genes were strain-specific\nsingletons that comprised 7.5% to 15.1% of the strain’s predicted\nproteomes. In respect to divergence from the core genome, strain\nPf-5 was found to possess the highest proportion of unique genes\n(n = 949) followed by 2-79 (n = 887). The entire pangenome of\nthe Pseudomonas strains encompassed over 12,000 homolog and\nsingleton gene families.\nFurther homolog family-based comparisons identified Q8r1-\n96 and R1-43-08 as the most distantly related strains, with\n3349 shared homologs (Supplementary Table 4A). Q8r1-96 and\nQ2-87, which shared 4,489 homologs, were the most closely\nrelated strains. The partitioning of homolog gene families into\nthe core, non-core, and singleton parts of the pangenome agreed\nwith phylogenetic relationships of the strains deduced from the\nanalysis of a selected subset of COGs (Clusters of Orthologous\nGroups) (Figure 2C and Supplementary Tables 4B,C). The\nCOG-based phylogeny supported the multilocus sequence\nanalysis and revealed that the eight Pseudomonas strains form\nthree distinct clusters, the first of which contained 2-79, R1-30-\n84, and SBW25. The second cluster included Q8r1-96 and Q2-87,\nwhereas the third encompassed strains 30-84, Pf-5, and Pf0-1.\nCorrelating the Composition of Root\nExudates With Metabolic Profiles of\nPseudomonas Strains\nWe used the Phenotype MicroArray PM1 and PM2 plates to\nprofile the eight Pseudomonas strains for the utilization of\n190 different carbon sources. Results of the analysis identified\n90 compounds that supported growth and clustered by their\nintensities of utilization into three distinct groups (Figure 3).\nGroup I was comprised of 30 highly metabolized carbon\nsources, which included several amino acids and intermediates of\nglycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, and citrate cycle. Approximately\nhalf of these compounds were catabolized by all eight strains,\nand included several organic acids (fumaric, citric, gluconic,\nmalic, and pyroglutamic), amino acids (Glu, Asn, Gln, Asp, Pro,\nAla, and g-aminobutyric acid), carbohydrates (glucose, mannose,\nand mannitol), and the purine nucleoside inosine. Group II\nwas composed of 44 chemically diverse carbon sources that\nwere variably utilized by the strains. These compounds were\ncarbohydrates, organic acids, amino acids, phenolics, and polyols,\nand included known compatible solutes and intermediates of\nmetabolism of pentoses, galactose, starch, and sucrose. Group\nIII encompassed the rest of the Phenotype MicroArray test\npanel and contained compounds that were not catabolized\nby the tested strains. Among several notable exceptions were\na-hydroxyglutamic acid- g-lactone, putrescine, and itaconic,\ncitramalic, and succinamic acids, which supported the growth\nof strains 2-79, 30-84, Pf-5, and SBW25.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nFIGURE 1 | Neighbor joining phylogeny showing the relationship of the eight strains used in this study (indicated by red triangles) to different species of the\nP. fluorescens complex. The phylogeny was established based on the concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S rRNA), gyrB (subunit B of DNA\ngyrase), rpoB (b subunit of RNA polymerase), and rpoD (sigma 70 factor subunit of RNA polymerase). Distance matrices were calculated by the Jukes-Cantor\nmethod. Colored circles on tree nodes indicate bootstrap values (1,000 replicates) that vary between 60% (smallest circle) and 100% (largest circles).\nB. distachyon Bd21. Interestingly, many carbon sources from\nthe Phenotype MicroArray panel were also present in the root\nexudates of B. distachyon Bd21, and some of these compounds\n(glucose, mannose, galactose, fructose, g-aminobutyric acid,\naspartic acid, citric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, quinic acid,\nalanine, glutamine, and glutamic acid) were catabolized by all\nstrains used in this study, while others (e.g., xylose, trehalose,\nm-inositol) were actively utilized only by certain organisms\n(Figure 3). The comparison of catabolic profiles across the\neight studied Pseudomonas strains revealed the presence of three\ndistinct clusters. The first cluster contained strains Q8r1-96 and\nQ2-87, which consumed very similar sets of carbon sources,\nas well as strain Pf0-1. The second cluster was composed of\n2-79, R1-43-08, SBW25, and 30-84, whereas the third cluster\nwas represented by a single strain, Pf-5. The overall similarity\nof the catabolic profiles partially agreed with the separation\nof the strains into different subgroups of the P. fluorescens\ncomplex (see above).\nAnalysis of the RNA-seq Results\nIn order to understand the cellular responses of rhizosphere\nPseudomonas to plant exometabolites, we analyzed the\ntranscriptome changes in cultures grown in the presence of\nroot exudates. Under field conditions, rhizobacteria colonize\nplant roots in the form of surface-attached microaerobic biofilms\n(Hojberg et al., 1999). To mimic these conditions, the eight\nPseudomonas strains were grown statically at 72% air saturation\nin 21C-glucose medium amended with root exudates and then\nprocessed to extract total RNA (Supplementary Figure 2).\nA total of 995 million raw sequencing reads were generated from\nthe RNA samples by using the Illumina HiSeq-2500 platform,\naveraging 20.7 million reads per sample. The removal of lowquality\nand rRNA sequences resulted in a total of 793 million\nfiltered reads that were mapped onto the eight Pseudomonas\ngenomes with a mean of 7.48 million mapped fragments per\ngenome. The differentially abundant transcripts were identified\nby setting a p value of 0.05 (adjusted for multiple testing) and\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 6 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

(B) The gradual expansion of\nthe pangenome (blue color) and contraction of the core genome (green color) following the sequential addition of genomes from the dataset. Box plots indicate the\n25th and 75th percentiles and medians (horizontal lines) with whiskers corresponding to the 10th and 90th percentiles. The input order was randomized to avoid any\nbias due to the sequential addition of new genomes. The pangenome size increases steadily without reaching a plateau even after the addition of 11,939\nnon-redundant gene families. At the same time, the core genome converged to 3,179 genes. (C) The pangenome-based phylogenomic analysis of the studied\nstrains. Here, the pangenome was defined with OrthoMCL, and orthologous gene sets were then partitioned into the core, singleton, and non-core (the remaining\northolog sets) categories. These categories were calculated for each node in the Maximum Likelihood species tree, using the set of genomes for which that node\nrepresents the ancestor. The results of the ortholog partitioning are shown in pie charts placed at tree nodes. Numbers indicate bootstrap support values. The\nanalysis was conducted in KBase (Arkin et al., 2018).\nthe log2 fold-change (FC) threshold \u2000\u2000 2.0 (Figure 4 and\nSupplementary Tables 5–12). When compared with the control\nconditions, an average of 204 genes per strain were differentially\nexpressed in the presence of root exudates, with the highest\n(n = 425) and lowest (n = 112) numbers observed, respectively,\nin SBW25 and Q2-87 (Figure 4). Overall, more genes were\ninduced than repressed in response to exudates, but the actual\nnumbers in each category varied substantially depending on the\nidentity of the Pseudomonas strain. In most strains, the bulk of\nthe differentially expressed genes was almost equally distributed\nbetween the core (mean, 48.2%) and non-core (mean, 45.8%)\nparts of the genome, whereas the strain-specific singleton genes\nconstituted on average only 5.9% (Figure 4B). One notable\nexception was observed in Q8r1-96, where all differentially\nexpressed genes belonged to the core (73.8%) and non-core\n(26.2%) parts of the genome. Another notable pattern was\nobserved in R1-43-08, where the majority of genes affected by\nthe presence of root exudate fell into the non-core category\n(56.3%). The highest proportion of differentially expressed\nsingletons (11.3 and 10.4%, respectively) was identified in\nstrains SBW25 and Pf-5.\nWe further explored how the identified differentially\nexpressed genes were distributed across genomes of the eight\nstudied rhizosphere strains. The pairwise BLASTp comparisons\nidentified 2-79 and SBW25 as two strains that shared the highest\nnumber of genes (n = 101) induced or repressed in response\nto root exudates (Table 1). The second pair of strains with\na significant number of similar differentially expressed genes\n(n = 86) was Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, which was followed by Pf0-1\nand 30-84, which shared 56 differentially expressed genes. These\npatterns of shared genes were also observed when the results of\nthe pairwise BLASTp comparisons were converted into a binary\ngene presence/absence matrix, which was then subjected to\ncluster analysis using a UPGMA algorithm based on Sorensen’s\ndissimilarity index or examined by non-metric multidimensional\nscaling (NMDS) (Figure 5).\nThe differentially expressed Pseudomonas genes were\nsubjected to Blast2Go analysis and Gene Ontology (GO)\nannotation (Figure 6). Metabolic process, catalytic activity,\nand membrane were the most common annotation terms\nacross the three primary GO term categories (i.e., biological\nprocess, molecular function, and cellular component). A total\nof 1,694 GO terms was assigned to 805 upregulated genes, with\nthe majority of the GO terms related to molecular function\n(682, 40.3%), followed by biological process (669, 39.5%), and\ncellular component (343, 20.2%). In the 539 downregulated gene\ncategory, 1,101 GO terms were assigned to biological process\n(420, 38.1%), molecular function (417, 37.9%), and cellular\ncomponent (264, 24.0%). Within biological process, metabolic\nprocess, cellular process, localization, response to stimulus, and\nregulation were over-represented. Within molecular function,\nthe largest proportion was assigned to catalytic activity, binding,\nand transporter activity categories. Within cellular component,\nthe majority were assigned to membrane, membrane part, cell,\nand cell part categories. Across the eight strains, 37–42% of\ndifferentially expressed genes had no Gene Ontology IDs and\nencoded various conserved hypothetical proteins.\nFunctional Classification of Shared\nDifferentially Expressed Genes\nThe interrogation of RNA-seq data revealed multiple cellular\npathways that were differentially regulated in bacterial cultures\nincubated with root exudates (Supplementary Figures 3, 4).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 7 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nFIGURE 3 | Biolog Phenotype MicroArray profiling the eight rhizosphere\nPseudomonas strains used in the study. The hierarchical clustering analysis\nwas carried out using the average linkage method with Euclidean distances.\nCarbon sources identified by red arrowheads were also detected in the sterile\nroot exudates of B. distachyon Bd21.\nAlthough none of these differentially regulated pathways were\nshared by all eight strains, the cross-strain comparisons revealed\nseveral types of common and specific transcriptomic responses\nthat were elicited by the presence of plant exometabolites\n(Table 2). The visual representation of core gene expression\npatterns is provided in Supplementary Figure 5, which\nshows heatmaps of expression profiles and p-adj values for\ncore genes shared by the studied strains. The figure is\naccompanied by Supplementary Table 13 that lists predicted\nfunctions of genes constituting the four distinct clusters\nobserved after hierarchical clustering of gene expression\nvalues. The first category of shared differentially expressed\npathways functioned in the uptake and catabolism of selected\ncarbohydrates, quaternary ammonium compounds (QAs), and\nphenolics. All strains except for R1-43-08, responded to root\nexudates by inducing the fructose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate\n(PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTSFru). The\ncomponents of this system are encoded by a conserved\noperon and include the cytoplasmic polyprotein EI/HPr/EIIAFru\n(FruB), the 1-phosphofructokinase FruK, and the fructosespecific\npermease EIIBC (FruA) (Chavarria et al., 2016). The\nPTSFru system functions by acquiring high-energy phosphates\nfrom PEP and sequentially passing them, via the EI/HPr/EIIAFru\ndomains of FruB, to the EIIB component of FruA. The\nphosphates are ultimately transferred by the EIIC transporter\nto fructose yielding fructose 1-phosphate, which is channeled\ninto the central metabolic pathways through the action of the\nphosphofructokinase FruK.\nIn all strains except for Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, the exposure to root\nexudates resulted in the induction of two genes adjacent to the\nfru cluster that encoded a Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS)\ntransporter and an L-arabinonate dehydratase (Table 2). These\ngenes are predicted to participate in the uptake and catabolism\nof L-arabinose, where L-arabinonate dehydratase plays an\nimportant role by converting L-arabinonate to 2-dehydro-3-\ndeoxy-L-arabinonate (Rahman et al., 2017). In SBW25, R1-\n43-08, and Q2-87, we also observed the induction of genes\nencoding components of the AraFGH complex, an ATP-Binding\nCassette (ABC) superfamily transporter involved in the import of\narabinose into the cell (Supplementary Tables 6, 7, 9). Finally, all\nstrains except SBW25 and R1-43-08 responded to the presence\nof exudates by upregulating a conserved gene encoding an\naldose epimerase superfamily protein. Such enzymes equilibrate\nalpha- and beta-anomers of aldoses and ensure that stereospecific\nenzymes involved in the metabolism of free sugars do not act as\nmetabolic bottlenecks (Abayakoon et al., 2018). Although some\naldose epimerases have been linked to specific pathways, the\nPseudomonas gene identified in this study could not be assigned\nto a particular metabolic process based on sequence analysis and\ngenomic location.\nSeveral Pseudomonas strains responded to the presence\nof root exudates by upregulating genes involved in the\nuptake and catabolism of myo-inositol and possibly other\nstereoisomers of inositol (Table 2). The upregulated catabolic\ngenes encode the dehydrogenase IolG, which oxidizes myoinositol\nto its corresponding ketone, as well as IolE, IolD, IolB,\nand IolC that collectively convert the 2-keto-myo-inositol to\nacetyl-CoA and the glycolysis intermediate dihydroxyacetone\nphosphate (Yoshida et al., 2008; Kohler et al., 2011).

The cross-genome comparisons revealed\nthat in all studied strains except for Pf0-1, components\nof the myo-inositol utilization pathway were encoded\nwithin a well-conserved gene cluster which, in addition to\ncatabolic and transport functions, also encodes a dedicated\ntranscriptional repressor.\nAll studied strains of Pseudomonas carry multiple genes\ninvolved in scavenging the quaternary ammonium compounds\ncholine, glycine betaine (GB), carnitine, choline-O-sulfate, and\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 9 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

Many of these genes were\ndifferentially expressed, including those encoding parts of the\nABC transporter CbcXWV, which is predicted to function in\nthe uptake of choline under water-replete conditions (Table 2).\nAmong enzymes induced in the presence of root exudates were\nthe choline dehydrogenase BetA, which converts choline to\nglycine betaine and a network of enzymes (i.e., the Rieske family\noxygenase GbcAB, the dimethyglycine demethylase DgcAB, and\nthe sarcosine oxidase SoxBDAG) that sequentially convert GB\nto glycine. In 2-79 and SBW25, this group of differentially\nregulated genes also included an AraC-family transcriptional\nactivator GbdR, which perceives intercellular levels of GB and\ninduces genes involved in the transport and catabolism of\nglycine betaine and detoxification of the catabolic byproducts\n(Hampel et al., 2014).\nThe last category of activated catabolic pathways included the\ncatechol branch of the b-ketoadipate pathway for the degradation\nof aromatic compounds. In strains 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5,\ngrowth on root exudates resulted in upregulation of catechol-\n1,2-dioxygenase, muconate cycloisomerase, and muconolactone\nisomerase, which collectively cleave the catechol ring and\nconvert it to b-ketoadipate enol-lactone (Harwood and Parales,\n1996). Finally, analysis of the P. synxantha 2-79 transcriptome\nidentified an induction of benABC genes encoding subunits\nof benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase, an oxidoreductase that generates\ncatechol from benzoate.\nIn addition to various catabolic pathways, the exposure to root\nexudates also induced several genes involved in the homeostasis\nof copper (Table 2). Four of these genes form a conserved cluster\nin genomes of the strains and encode the periplasmic coppersensing\ntwo-component system CinRS, the plastocyanin/azurinlike\nprotein CinA, and the NADPH-dependent pre-Q0 reductase\nCinQ. Also, in strains Q2-87, 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, we observed\nupregulation of a conserved operon encoding the multicopper\noxidase CopA, the periplasmic copper-binding protein CopC, the\ninner membrane protein CopD, and outer membrane protein\nCopB. In several Gram-negative bacteria, these Cop proteins are\nthought to have dual functions and participate both in the uptake\nof essential copper as well as in the sequestration of excess copper\nin the periplasm and outer membrane.\nThe analysis of shared downregulated pathways revealed that\nmost of the strains respond to the presence of root exudates by\nrepressing genes involved in the uptake and catabolism of sulfur\ncompounds (Table 2). In strains SBW25, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96,\nQ2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, this response involved the ssuEADCB\noperon responsible for the utilization of alkanesulfonates\nas sulfur sources. The ssu operon is highly conserved in\nfluorescent pseudomonads and encodes the FMNH2-dependent\nmonooxygenase SsuD and the NAD (P)H-dependent FMN\nreductase SsuE, which together catalyze the desulfonation of\nalkanesulfonates. Also, the ssu locus contains genes for the\nmolybdopterin-binding protein SsuF and the alkanesulfonatespecific\nABC-type transporter consisting of the sulfonate\nsubstrate-binding protein SsuA, sulfonate permease protein\nSsuC, and sulfonate transport ATP-binding protein SsuB. Finally,\nin R1-43-08, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, growth on root exudates\ncoincided with repression of the tauABCD operon, which\nallows these strains to utilize taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonate)\nas a sulfur source. The repressed tau genes encoded the\n2-oxoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenase TauD and\nsubstrate-binding, ATP-binding, and permease components of\nthe taurine-specific ABC transporter TauABC.\nOther Differentially Expressed Pathways\nIn addition to their effect on several shared cellular pathways,\ngrowth on root exudates resulted in the induction or repression of\nnumerous strain-specific genes. In closely related P. synxantha 2-\n79 and P. fluorescens SBW25, we observed differential expression\nof genes involved in energy metabolism, transport of amino\nacids, and surface attachment (Supplementary Tables 5, 6).\nOther notable differentially expressed pathways included 2–\n79 gene clusters that encode enzymes for the catabolism of\ntrehalose, a prophage, and toxin/antitoxin system, as well as the\nSBW25 operon predicted to control the synthesis of the capsular\nexopolysaccharide colonic acid. The response of Pseudomonas sp.\nR1-43-08 to root exudates also involved differential expression\nof different energy metabolism pathways. In addition, we\nobserved the upregulation of genes involved in the uptake and\ncatabolism of xylose (also upregulated in 2–79) and repression\nof enzymes for the biosynthesis of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid\nand assimilation of inorganic sulfur and L-cysteine biosynthesis\n(Supplementary Table 7).\nThe analysis of the Q8r1-96 transcriptome revealed\nperturbation of different metabolic pathways including genes\nencoding components of cytochrome C oxidase, transport\nand catabolism of sorbitol/mannitol, metabolism of butanoic\nacid, and biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides alginate and\npoly-b-1-6-N-acetylglucosamine (Supplementary Table 8). In\nP. fluorescens Q2-87, we identified differential expression of\ngenes involved in metabolism of galactose, tryptophan, tyrosine,\nglycine, serine, and threonine (Supplementary Table 9),\nwhile in P. chlororaphis 30-84, growth on exudates activated\nthe biosynthesis of molybdopterin cofactor, catabolism of\ngalactonate and acetoin, and uptake and catabolism of putrescine\n(Supplementary Table 10). The response of P. protegens Pf-5 to\nroot exudates involved upregulation of acetoin dehydrogenase,\nwhich converts acetoin to acetaldehyde and acetyl-CoA, as\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 10 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

The terms were derived from 93 different functional groups (GO subcategories level 4). The GO terms were assigned with Blast2GO (Conesa\nand Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al., 2018). On a WEGO histogram, the percentage of 100 is defined as the total number of genes assigned a GO\nterm. However, the subcategories do not add up to 100% because many genes fall into more than one functional class and are therefore annotated by multiple GO\nterms.\nwell as pathways for the utilization of glycolate and putrescine\n(Supplementary Table 11). Also induced were genes for\nthe production of pyrrolnitrin and PhlG hydrolase, which\nmodulate the metabolic loads attributed to the synthesis of\n2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol. The differentially expressed genes of\nP. fluorescens Pf0-1 included, among others, operons encoding\ncytochrome C oxidase and enzymes for catabolism of malonic\nacid (Supplementary Table 12). Yet another interesting\nfinding involved the induction of assorted genes acting in the\nhomeostasis of iron and defense against reactive oxygen species\n(ROS). We observed activation of iron dicitrate transporters\n(SBW25 and 30-84), genes for the biosynthesis of siderophores\nornicorrugatin (SBW25) and pyochelin (Pf-5), heme-degrading\nenzymes (2–79, 30–84), TonB siderophore receptors, and\ncomponents of the energy-transducing inner membrane\ncomplex TonB-ExbB-ExbD (2–79 and Pf-5). The differentially\nexpressed ROS defense pathways were represented by different\ncatalases in strains 2–79, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and\nPf-5 and organic hydroperoxide resistance proteins in strains\nSBW25 and R1-43-08.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nsoil microorganisms. Our results were in agreement with a\nrecent report of 27 different sugars, amino acids, and organic\nacids in Brachypodium exudates (Kawasaki et al., 2016). We\nconfirmed the presence of exometabolites identified in that\nstudy, along with dozens of additional analytes that were\nidentified by matching their mass-spectra and retention indices\nto the LECO/Fiehn Metabolomics library (Supplementary\nTable 3). The complementation of the metabolomic analysis\nwith profiling of the bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays\nrevealed that a substantial proportion of the characterized\nexudate constituents were catabolized by a collection of eight\nPseudomonas strains from across the P. fluorescens group that is\nknown to form associations with plant roots. The amendment\nof Pseudomonas cultures with root exudates caused changes in\nthe expression of multiple genes encoding catabolic and anabolic\nenzymes, predicted transporters, transcriptional regulators, stress\nresponse, and conserved hypothetical proteins. In most strains,\nthese differentially expressed genes were almost equally split\nbetween the core and variable genome regions, mirroring\nthe substantial strain-to-strain variation in the genome size\nand gene content within the P. fluorescens species complex\n(Loper et al., 2012).\nThe analysis of transcriptome responses to root exudates\nrevealed several types of cellular pathways present in the strains\nused in this study. The first category of such pathways was\ninvolved in the catabolism of carbohydrates such as fructose,\narabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, trehalose, and galactose. Among\nthese catabolic traits, the ability to utilize fructose as a carbon\nsource is highly conserved among fluorescent pseudomonads.\nIn contrast, growth on arabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, and\ntrehalose is variably present and was traditionally used to\ndifferentiate species and biovars within the P. fluorescens\ngroup (Barrett et al., 1986). We speculate that such variably\ndistributed pathways contribute to the differential affinity of\npseudomonads toward host plants and/or to determine which\nstrains flourish in response to growing roots and changing\nenvironments. Several independent studies have confirmed\nthe importance of carbohydrate catabolism pathways for the\nbiology of rhizosphere pseudomonads. For example, in vivo\nexpression technology (IVET) profiling of P. fluorescens SBW25\nidentified xylose isomerase among genome regions essential\nfor the colonization of sugar beet seedlings (Liu et al., 2015),\nwhereas a genome-wide Tn-Seq screen of Pseudomonas simiae\nidentified genes for the catabolism of myo-inositol among traits\nessential for the colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana roots\n(Cole et al., 2017).\nThe response of rhizosphere Pseudomonas to Brachypodium\nroot exudates also involved pathways for the uptake and\nmetabolism of amino acids. We observed differential\nexpression of genes encoding the hydrophobic (HAAT) and\npolar (PAAT) amino acid uptake transporters in strains\n2-79, SBW25, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5. Other related genes\nencoded enzymes for the catabolism of valine and glutamic\nacid (2-79); metabolism of tryptophan, glycine, serine, and\nthreonine (Q2-87); and biosynthesis of methionine (Q8r1-\n96). It is plausible that the abundance of amino acids in\nroot exudates is also linked to the repression of pathways\ninvolved in the catabolism of sulfonates and taurine that\nwas observed in several strains (Table 2). Although the\npreferred source of sulfur for P. fluorescens is unknown, in the\nclosely related P. aeruginosa, the sulfur starvation response\nis triggered by the growth on any sulfur compound other\nthan sulfate, thiocyanate, and cysteine (Hummerjohann et al.,\n1998). This fact, together with the presence of cysteine and\ncystine in the root exudates, suggest that root exudates of\nBrachypodium may serve as an important source of sulfur for\nrhizosphere Pseudomonas. These findings also agree well with\nthe reported scarcity of inorganic sulfate in the soil, and the\npresence of sulfur mostly in the form of organic compounds,\nincluding amino acids, proteins, sulfate esters, and sulfonates\n(Autry and Fitzgerald, 1990).\nAnother interesting result of this study was the concerted\nactivation of copper and iron homeostasis pathways observed\nin all of the Pseudomonas strains used in this work. In bacteria,\nan excess of copper is toxic and triggers oxidative stress due to\nthe formation of free radicals, as well as disruption of protein\nmetalation and stability of iron-sulfur clusters (Bondarczuk\nand Piotrowska-Seget, 2013). On the other hand, copper is an\nessential trace element used as a cofactor in different enzymes.\nSimilarly, although elevated levels of iron cause redox stress, this\nelement is also found in active energy metabolism enzymes and is\ncrucial for bacterial growth (Andrews et al., 2003). The analysis\nof metal homeostasis genes identified in this study suggests\nthat their induction was likely triggered by the deficiency of\ncopper and iron in bacterial cultures grown in the presence of\nroot exudates. We attribute this effect to the ability of some\ncomponents of root exudates to chelate soil metals.\nDespite the abundance of iron in the soil, its bioavailability\nis limited due to the low solubility of Fe (III) oxyhydrates\nat neutral pH. The non-graminaceous plants circumvent this\nproblem by acidifying the rhizosphere and secreting flavins,\nphenolics, and organic acids that chelate iron. The reduction\nof these ferric chelates releases soluble ferrous iron taken up\nby root cells (Kobayashi and Nishizawa, 2012). Graminaceous\nplants, like Brachypodium, acquire iron by secreting into the\nsoil non-protein amino acids of the mugineic acid (MA) group,\nwhich act as Fe (III)-chelating phytosiderophores. In addition to\niron, low-molecular-weight organic acids and phytosiderophores\nbind other divalent and trivalent metals (including copper) and\ncontribute to heavy-metal tolerance in plants (Chen et al., 2017).\nIt is plausible that the presence of these plant exometabolites\nis responsible for the deficit of iron and copper observed in\nPseudomonas cultures grown in the presence of root exudates.\nThese results further underscore the importance of diverse and\nredundant metal homeostasis pathways found in genomes of the\nP. fluorescens group for the ability of these organisms to colonize\nand persist in the plant rhizosphere.\nRecently, Klonowska et al. (2018) examined transcriptomic\nresponses of symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria to root\nexudates of the legume plant Mimosa pundica, which has\nan unusual ability to support both alpha- (Rhizobium) and\nbeta-rhizobia (Cupriavidus and Burkholderia). Using RNA-seq,\nthe authors characterized genes involved in the perception of\nroot exudates in the nodulating bacteria Burkholderia phymatum\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 14 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nSTM815, Cupriavidus taiwanensis LMG19424, and Rhizobium\nmesoamericanum STM3625. Interestingly, the analysis of\ndifferentially expressed genes revealed induction of pathways\ninvolved in the catabolism of fructose, xylose, myo-inositol,\nand protocatechuate/catechol. Also upregulated were some\ncopper homeostasis, siderophore biosynthesis, and oxidative\nstress genes. Finally, the analytical profiling of M. pundica\nexudates revealed an overlap with Brachypodium in the types of\ncarbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids present. These\nfindings suggest that differentially expressed genes shared by\nmultiple strains of the group P. fluorescens are not unique to\nthe Brachypodium-Pseudomonas system but represent a set\nof conserved cellular pathways involved in the perception of\nplant exometabolites by different clades of rhizosphere-dwelling\nProteobacteria.\nMost strains included in this study were originally selected\nbased on the ability to colonize the rhizosphere and produce\nsecondary metabolites that alleviate the plant stress response\nand/or inhibit soilborne pathogens. It has been suggested\nthat plant metabolites released into the rhizosphere affect\nthe biocontrol activity of plant-beneficial pseudomonads (de\nWerra et al., 2011). We provide further support to this\nhypothesis by demonstrating that in some strains, root exudates\nmodulate the expression of genes for the catabolism of\nthe plant growth-promoting metabolites acetoin and 2,3-\nbutanediol. The exposure to exudates also affected the expression\nof genes for the synthesis of well-characterized antifungal\ncompounds pyrrolnitrin, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, and 2,4-\ndiacetylphloroglucinol. The modulatory effects were strainspecific,\nsuggesting significant differences in the regulatory\nnetworks involved in the perception of plant signals and\nregulation of the production of antibiotics and growthpromoting\nmetabolites.\nThe final significant finding of this study was the induction\nof catabolism of quaternary amines (QAs) observed in multiple\nstrains of the P. fluorescens group during growth on root\nexudates. This observation was supported by the detection of\nglycine betaine in the root secretions of B. distachyon. The\npresence of QAs in plant tissues and the capacity of these\nmetabolites to provide stress protection and nutrients to plant\npathogens and symbionts were reported before (Boncompagni\net al., 1999; Chen et al., 2013; Kabbadj et al., 2017), but our\nstudy is among the first to highlight the potential importance of\nthese metabolites for rhizosphere interactions. Pseudomonads do\nnot synthesize QAs de novo but have evolved many pathways to\nscavenge them from eukaryotic hosts, where these metabolites\nare abundant due to the prominence of phosphatidylcholine\nin cellular membranes. Strains of P. fluorescens carry genes\nfor the conversion of choline, carnitine, and glycine betaine to\nglycine, as well as quaternary amine transporters of the BCCT\nand ABC families that are also conserved in the opportunistic\nhuman pathogen P. aeruginosa and the plant pathogen P. syringae\n(Galvao et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2013; Wargo, 2013b).\nIn P. aeruginosa, choline catabolism genes are essential for\nthe ability of this pathogen to persist during lung infection\n(Wargo, 2013a). Similarly, a P. syringae mutant deficient in\nBetT, OpuC, and CbcXWV quaternary amine transporters had\nreduced fitness during colonization of bean and soybean leaves\nunder greenhouse and field conditions (Chen et al., 2013).\nDepending on water availability, P. aeruginosa and P. syringae\ncatabolize exogenously supplied QAs as carbon and nitrogen\nsources or accumulate them as osmoprotectants (Chen et al.,\n2013; Wargo, 2013b). Our ongoing work in P. synxantha 2–\n79 unraveled similar physiological responses and demonstrated\nthat QA transporters function differentially and redundantly\nin the uptake of quaternary amines as nutrients (Pablo and\nMavrodi, unpublished). In contrast, under water stress, the QAs\ncholine, betaine, and carnitine are accumulated preferentially for\nosmoprotection. Under drought stress, a 2–79 mutant devoid\nof all known QA transporters was less competitive in the\ncolonization of the Brachypodium rhizosphere than its wild-type\nparental strain. Interestingly, our metabolomic profiling of root\nexudates also revealed proline, glutamine, and hydroxyectoine.\nThese metabolites act as compatible solutes in different groups\nof microorganisms (Yancey et al., 1982; Empadinhas and da\nCosta, 2008), suggesting an important role of root exudates\nin the ability of Pseudomonas to persist in the rhizosphere of\ndrought-stressed plants.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe original contributions presented in the study are publicly\navailable.

Plant roots secrete carbon-rich rhizodeposits containing primary and\nsecondary low molecular weight metabolites, lysates, and mucilages. These exudates\nprovide nutrients for soil microorganisms and modulate their affinity to host plants, but\nmolecular details of this process are largely unresolved. We addressed this gap by\nfocusing on the molecular dialog between eight well-characterized beneficial strains\nof the Pseudomonas fluorescens group and Brachypodium distachyon, a model for\neconomically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops of the grass family. We\ncollected and analyzed root exudates of B. distachyon and demonstrated the presence\nof multiple carbohydrates, amino acids, organic acids, and phenolic compounds. The\nsubsequent screening of bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays revealed that many\nof these metabolites provide carbon and energy for the Pseudomonas strains. RNAseq\nprofiling of bacterial cultures amended with root exudates revealed changes in the\nexpression of genes encoding numerous catabolic and anabolic enzymes, transporters,\ntranscriptional regulators, stress response, and conserved hypothetical proteins. Almost\nhalf of the differentially expressed genes mapped to the variable part of the strains’\npangenome, reflecting the importance of the variable gene content in the adaptation of\nP. fluorescens to the rhizosphere lifestyle. Our results collectively reveal the diversity\nof cellular pathways and physiological responses underlying the establishment of\nmutualistic interactions between these beneficial rhizobacteria and their plant hosts.\nKeywords: Pseudomonas, Brachypodium, rhizosphere, root exudates, transcriptome\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 1 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nINTRODUCTION\nPlants are meta-organisms or holobionts that rely in part on\ntheir microbiome for specific functions and traits. The ability\nof the plant microbiome to influence plant development, vigor,\nhealth, and fitness in response to abiotic stressors associated\nwith global climate change is documented by numerous studies\n(Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009). There is mounting evidence\nthat plants actively recruit beneficial microbiomes, but many\naspects of this process are still very much a black box (Reinhold-\nHurek et al., 2015). The foundation for the differential affinity\nof rhizobacteria toward host plants is built upon complex\nchemical cross talk between microorganisms and plant roots.\nUp to 40% of photosynthetically fixed carbon is released by\nplant roots in the form of exudates and secretions, lysates, and\nmucilages (Curl and Truelove, 1986; Lynch, 1990; Whipps, 1990;\nBadri and Vivanco, 2009). The release of these compounds is\nactively controlled in response to environmental stimuli, and the\ncomposition of root exudates varies greatly according to plant\nspecies and physiological condition (Lynch, 1990; Nguyen, 2003;\nPhillips et al., 2004; De-la-Pena et al., 2008). The presence and\ncomposition of exudates strongly impact soil microorganisms,\nwhich is consistent with the idea that plants actively select and\nshape their root microbiota (Zolla et al., 2013).\nPrimary root exudates include simple and complex sugars,\namino acids, polypeptides and proteins, organic, aliphatic and\nfatty acids, sterols, and phenolics (Nguyen, 2003; Badri and\nVivanco, 2009; Badri et al., 2009). These compounds serve as\ncarbon and energy sources for rhizobacteria, and the presence\nof the intact corresponding catabolic pathways is essential\nfor competitive colonization of roots and disease suppression\n(Lugtenberg et al., 2001; Kamilova et al., 2005; Lugtenberg and\nKamilova, 2009). Root exudates also contain numerous signal\nmolecules and secondary metabolites, the significance of which\nis only now emerging (Walker et al., 2003; Bais et al., 2005,\n2006). A handful of analyses of plant-induced gene expression\nby transcriptional profiling in vitro (Mark et al., 2005) or in\nthe rhizosphere (Silby and Levy, 2004; Ramos-Gonzalez et al.,\n2005; Matilla et al., 2007; Barret et al., 2009) have identified\nmultiple genes that are differentially regulated by exposure to\nroots or root exudates. Bacterial pathways expressed during\nrhizosphere colonization control utilization of plant-derived\nmetabolites (Simons et al., 1996, 1997; Camacho-Carvajal, 2001;\nLugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), motility and chemotaxis (de\nWeert et al., 2002; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), phase\nvariation (Dekkers et al., 1998; Sanchez-Contreras et al., 2002;\nvan den Broek et al., 2005), outer membrane integrity (de Weert\net al., 2006; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), and the ability\nto sequester limiting resources (Raaijmakers et al., 1995) and\nresist environmental stresses (Sarniguet et al., 1995; Miller and\nWood, 1996; van Veen et al., 1997; Schnider-Keel et al., 2001). In\nits spatial and temporal properties, root colonization resembles\nbiofilm formation, and biofilm-related pathways also have been\nimplicated in adhesion to seeds and roots and rhizosphere\ncolonization (Espinosa-Urgel et al., 2000; Hinsa et al., 2003;\nYousef-Coronado et al., 2008; Fuqua, 2010; Martinez-Gil et al.,\n2010; Nielsen et al., 2011; Zboralski and Filion, 2020). Finally,\nroot exudates strongly affect the expression of diverse plant\ngrowth promotion and biocontrol genes (Vacheron et al., 2013).\nOver the past decade, the genomes of numerous rhizosphere\nstrains have been sequenced and analyzed, but functional\ngenomics studies of rhizosphere competence lag behind the\navailability of sequence data.\nThis study explored the molecular dialog between the\nmodel host plant Brachypodium distachyon and several wellcharacterized\nrhizosphere strains of the Pseudomonas fluorescens\ngroup. Brachypodium is a small annual grass originating in semiarid\nregions of the Middle East that has emerged as a prime model\nfor economically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops\nof the grass family (Bevan et al., 2010; Schwartz et al., 2010;\nBrkljacic et al., 2011; Hong et al., 2011; Tyler et al., 2014). The\nbiology, extensive collection of resources, and research tools\nmake B. distachyon an attractive model to investigate interactions\nbetween plants and root-associated microbes. Pseudomonads\nare ubiquitous Gram-negative g-proteobacteria that colonize\neukaryotic hosts and include both commensals and economically\nimportant pathogens of plants and animals (Moore et al.,\n2006; Schroth et al., 2006; Yahr and Parsek, 2006). The genus\nPseudomonas currently comprises > 100 named species that have\nbeen separated based on multilocus sequence analysis into 14\nspecies groups (Garrido-Sanz et al., 2016; Hesse et al., 2018).\nThe P. fluorescens group is the most diverse regarding both\nthe genetic distances within it, the number of species and the\nlarge pangenome that makes up > 50% of the pangenome\nof the genus as a whole (Loper et al., 2012). The group also\nencompasses an unusually high proportion of strains that inhabit\nthe plant rhizosphere and possess plant growth promoting and\nbiocontrol properties. Naylor et al. (2017) profiled bacterial\ncommunities associated with root tissues and rhizosphere of\n18 different plant species of the Poaceae family. That study\nidentified Pseudomonas among taxa constituting the core grass\nroot microbiome and demonstrated that these bacteria were\nenriched in C3 plants, including wheat, rye, barley, oat, and\nBrachypodium. We confirmed the capacity of B. distachyon\nBd21 to serve as a host for rhizobacteria of the P. fluorescens\ngroup in preliminary greenhouse assays with biocontrol strains\nP. synxantha 2-79, P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96, and P. protegens\nPf-5. Results of these experiments revealed that all strains\nsuccessfully established and colonized the roots of Brachypodium\n(Supplementary Table 1).\nIn this study, we focused on eight well-studied strains\nof the P. fluorescens complex that are supported by years\nof studies, numerous refereed publications, and high-quality\ngenome sequences. By profiling transcriptomes of these strains\nduring growth in root exudates of B. distachyon, we revealed the\ndiversity of cellular pathways and physiological responses that\nunderlie the establishment of mutualistic interactions between\nbeneficial rhizobacteria and the host plant. Our results also\nconfirmed that root exudates contain carbohydrates, amino acids,\norganic acids, and phenolics that serve as carbon and energy\nsources for rhizobacteria. The root exudates also contained\nosmoprotectants that may help microorganisms to persist in the\nrhizosphere of drought-stressed plants.

R1-43-08 (Parejko\net al., 2012), P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96 (Raaijmakers and Weller,\n1998), P. fluorescens Q2-87 (Bangera and Thomashow, 1996),\nP. chlororaphis 30-84 (Thomashow et al., 1990), P. fluorescens\nPf0-1 (Silby et al., 2009), and P. protegens Pf-5 (Howell and\nStipanovic, 1980). The selected organisms have been studied\nextensively for their role in biological control and plant\ngrowth promotion (Supplementary Table 2). The strains were\nmaintained in the laboratory as frozen stocks (\U0010000080\u2000C) and\nroutinely cultured in King’s medium B (King et al., 1954) or\n21C medium, which contained (per 1 L): 1.0 g of NH4Cl, 3.5 g\nof Na2HPO4\u20002H2O, 2.8 g of KH2PO4, 3.0 g of glucose, and\n20 ml of a microelement solution (Smibert and Kreig, 1994;\nHalverson and Firestone, 2000).\nPropagation of Plants and Collection of\nRoot Exudates\nB. distachyon Bd21 was established from seed material obtained\nfrom the USDA-ARS Plant Germplasm Introduction and Testing\nResearch Unit (Pullman, WA, United States). Brachypodium\nseeds were imbibed for 3 days at 4\u2000C and sown in 7 \u2000 7 cm\npots filled with Sunshine Potting Mix #4 (Sun Gro Horticulture,\nAgawam, MA, United States). Plants were grown in an IR-\n89X (Percival Scientific, Perry, IA, United States) controlled\nenvironment chamber retrofitted with 6500K and 3000K T5 54W\ngrow lights (Spectralux) under a 20-h light, 24\u2000C/4-h dark, 18\u2000C\ncycle. Plants were watered and fertilized with Jack’s professional\nwater-soluble fertilizer (20:20:20) (JR Peters, Allentown, PA,\nUnited States). After 12 weeks and plant senescence, seeds\nwere collected, processed, and stored under desiccant and dark\nconditions at room temperature.\nTo collect root exudates, seeds of B. distachyon Bd21 were\nsurface-sterilized, pregerminated, and placed in sterile 1 L widemouth\nglass jars containing 113 g of 6-mm glass beads and\n25 ml distilled water. Jars were covered with vented caps\nand plants were grown hydroponically in an environmental\ncontrolled growth chamber under conditions described above.\nAfter 6 days, root exudates were extracted from individual\njars and their sterility was confirmed by spotting on nutrient\nagar. Multiple batches of root exudates were collected, filtered\n(0.22 mm), aliquoted in Falcon tubes (10 ml), lyophilized, and\nstored at –80\u2000C.\nMetabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates\nExudates were analyzed for primary metabolites at the Murdock\nMetabolomics Laboratory at Washington State University\n(Pullman, WA, United States). Freeze-dried residues were\nsuspended in 500 ml 50% aqueous acetonitrile and clarified by\ncentrifugation for 20 min at 21,000 \u2000 g and 4\u2000C. The liquid\nchromatography mass spectrometry analysis was conducted\nwith a Synapt G2-S quadrupole-ion mobility spectrometrytime\nof flight mass spectrometer system equipped with an\nacquity ultra-performance liquid chromatograph (UPLC) and\nan acquity photodiode array detector (all from Waters, Milford,\nMA, United States). The exudate metabolites were separated\non a SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC HPLC column (2.1 \u2000 100 mm,\n3 mm) (Milllipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, United States) using\nacetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid as solvent B and water\nwith 0.1% formic acid as solvent A at a flow rate of 400 ml\nmin\U001000001 and the following linear gradient extending over 14 min:\n0 min, 80% B; 4 min, 80% B, 6 min: 10% B; 7.5 min, 10%\nB; 10 min, 80% B; and 14 min, 80% B. Mass spectra were\ncollected in positive ion mode over a range of m/z 50–1,200\nwith a scan time of 0.2 s. The Q-TOF-MS source was at\n3.0 kV and 120\u2000C; the sampling cone at 40 V, desolvation\ntemperature was 250\u2000C; cone gas and desolvation gas flow were\nat 0 and 850 L h\U001000001, respectively. Leucine enkephalin was used\nfor post-acquisition mass correction. Target compounds were\nvisualized using selected ion chromatograms at 0.05 Da window\nwidth. The compound identification was based on comparison\nof chromatographic behavior and accurate masses to those of\nauthentic standards.\nFor gas chromatography, derivatization was carried out using\na modification of the procedure of Lee and Fiehn (2008).\nThe freeze-dried residues were suspended in 950 ml aqueous\nmethanol (84%, v/v) and clarified by centrifugation for 15 min\nat 21,000 \u2000 g at 4\u2000C. The supernatants were spiked with 1\nmg of the internal standard salicylic acid-d6 (C/D/N Isotopes,\nQuebec, Canada) and dried in vacuo. The dry residues were\nsuspended in 10 ml of O-methoxylamine hydrochloride (30 mg\nml\U001000001 in anhydrous pyridine, both from Millipore Sigma) and\nincubated while mixing (1,000 RPM) for 90 min at 30\u2000C.\nSubsequently, samples were derivatized with 90 ml of MSTFA\nwith 1% TMCS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,\nUnited States) for 30 min at 37\u2000C. Gas chromatography-mass\nspectroscopy analysis was performed using a Pegasus 4D timeof-\nflight mass spectrometer (LECO, Saint Joseph MI) equipped\nwith a MPS2 autosampler (Gerstel, Linthicum, MD) and a 7890A\noven (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States).\nThe derivatization products were separated on a 30-m, 0.25 mm\ni.d., 0.25 mm df Rxi-5Sil column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA,\nUnited States) with an IntegraGuard precolumn using ultrapure\nHe at a constant flow of 0.9 ml min\U001000001 as carrier gas. The linear\nthermal gradient started with a 1-min hold at 70\u2000C, followed\nby a ramp to 300\u2000C at 10\u2000C min\U001000001. The final temperature was\nheld for 5 min prior to returning to initial conditions. Mass\nspectra were collected at 17 spectra s\U001000001. Peak identification was\nconducted using the Fiehn primary metabolite library (Kind\net al., 2009) and an identity score cutoff of 700. Additionally,\nauthentic standards for a number of primary metabolites were\nanalyzed under identical conditions and the data used to compare\nthe chromatographic behavior. Peak alignment and spectrum\ncomparisons were carried out using the Statistical Compare\nfeature of ChromaTOF software (LECO).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 3 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nIsolation of RNA From Bacteria Cultured\nin Root Exudates and RNA-Seq\nThe strains were pregrown overnight at 25\u2000C on 21C-glucose\nagar and then subcultured into 96-well microplates containing\nliquid 21C-glucose medium amended with Brachypodium\nexudates. The liquid medium was prepared by dissolving the\nlyophilized root exudate material in an appropriate volume of\n21C-glucose medium to concentrate root exudates 20-fold. The\ngrowth medium was sterilized by passing it through a 0.22-\nmm membrane filter. The control cultures were grown under\nidentical conditions in the absence of exudates. All treatments\nwere inoculated at OD600 of 0.1 and incubated for 20 to\n22 h until cultures entered late-exponential growth phase at\n25\u2000C in an atmosphere of 15% oxygen [created by a ProOx\nP110 oxygen controller (BioSpherix, Parish, NY, United States)\nwith a hypoxia C-chamber]. The cells were stabilized by the\naddition RNAprotect reagent (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD,\nUnited States) and total RNA was purified using a RNeasy Protect\nBacteria Mini Kit (QIAGEN) from three biological replicates of\neach strain cultured under control conditions and in exudates.\nThe quality assessment of the extracted RNA samples was\nperformed with a NanoDrop OneC Spectrophotometer (Thermo\nFisher Scientific) and a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies)\nand revealed A260/A280 and A260/A230 values of > 2.0 and a mean\nRNA integrity numbers (RIN) value of > 9.2.\nThree biological replicates of RNA samples were shipped on\ndry ice to the DOE Joint Genome Institute (Walnut Creek, CA,\nUnited States), where rRNA was depleted and stranded RNASeq\nlibraries were prepared, quantified by qPCR and sequenced\nusing a HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina). The fastq file reads\nwere filtered and processed with BBDuk1 to remove reads that\ncontained 1 or more “N” bases, had an average quality score\nacross the read less than 10 or had a minimum length < 51 bp\nor 33% of the full read length. Reads mapped with BBMap (see\ntext footnote 2) to masked human, cat, dog, and mouse references\nat 93% identity were removed. Another category of removed\nsequences matched RNA spike-in, PhiX, common microbial\ncontaminants, and ribosomal RNAs. The processed reads from\neach library were aligned to the reference genome using BBMap\nwith only unique mappings allowed (BAMs/directory). If a\nread mapped to more than one location it was ignored.\nfeatureCounts (Liao et al., 2014) was used to generate raw\ngene counts, which were normalized to adjust for the length of\neach gene and total number of reads mapped for each library.\nThe normalization formula used: n = [r/(l/1,000)]/(t/1,000,000),\nwhere n = normalized read count for gene (G) for library (L);\nr = raw read count for gene G for library L; l = gene G length; and\nt = total reads mapped for library L. Raw gene counts were used to\nevaluate the level of correlation between biological samples using\nPearson’s correlation.\nBioinformatic Analysis\nCount tables generated by the JGI RNA-Seq pipeline were input\ninto DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) to normalize and determine\n1https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/\ndifferential expression. Statistical significance was established\nthrough DESeq2 by using three biological replicates for control\nand root exudate conditions. Scatterplots were generated from\nthe DESeq2 data table outputs using ggplot2. Genes differentially\nexpressed between control and root exudate samples (log2 foldchanges\n–2 \u2000 to \u2000 2, adjusted p value \u2000 0.05) were used in\ndownstream analysis. The core genome and pangenome for the\nPseudomonas strains used in this study were computed using the\nOthoMCL v.2.0, Species Tree Builder v.2.2.0, and Phylogenetic\nPangenome Accumulation v1.4.0 apps implemented in the U.S.\nDepartment of Energy Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase)\n(Arkin et al., 2018). Additional comparisons were conducted\nwith the PGAweb pangenome analysis pipeline (Chen et al.,\n2018). Differentially expressed genes were assigned to core,\nnon-core, and singleton parts of each strain’s proteome by\nBLASTp with an E value cutoff of e-06, identity of 40%\nand coverage of 60%. Functional annotation of differentially\nexpressed genes was carried out with the Blast2GO (Conesa\nand Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al.,\n2018). Additional manual curation was performed using tools\nimplemented in the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG)\ndatabase (Markowitz et al., 2012), Pseudomonas Genome\nDatabase (Winsor et al., 2009), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and\nGenomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa et al., 2008), and Geneious 10.2.3\n(Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand). Metabolic functions\nencoded by the differentially expressed genes were mapped\nusing iPath 3.0 (Darzi et al., 2018). Phylogenetic analyses\nwere carried out by building multiple sequence alignments\nwith MAFFT v7.222 (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and inferring\nneighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenies with Geneious Tree Builder.\nThe resultant phylogenetic trees were visualized with iTOL\n(Letunic and Bork, 2016). Reproducibility of clades within the\ninferred NJ trees was assessed by bootstrap resampling with\n1,000 replicates.\nCharacterization of Carbon Source\nUtilization With Biolog Phenotype\nMicroarrays\nThe utilization of carbon sources was analyzed using Phenotype\nMicroArrays (Biolog, Hayward, CA, United States) as follows.\nThe bacteria were cultured overnight on Luria-Bertani agar\nat 25\u2000C, after which cells were harvested and suspended in\ninoculating fluid (IF-0). The transmittance of the suspension\nwas adjusted to 42% using a Biolog turbidimeter. The cell\nsuspension was mixed with IF\U001000000 containing Dye Mix A\n(Biolog) to achieve a final transmittance of 85%. One hundred\nmicroliter aliquots of the adjusted cell suspension were\ninoculated into PM01 and PM02A plates, which were then\nincubated in an OmniLog Phenotype MicroArray System\n(Biolog) at 25\u2000C for 48 h. The formation of formazan was\nrecorded at 15 min intervals, and data were analyzed using\nOmniLog Parametric Analysis software v1.20.02 (Biolog).\nRelative growth of the studied strains was normalized to\ngrowth on D-glucose and visualized using Heatmapper\n(Babicki et al., 2016).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 4 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nData Availability\nSequences generated in this project were deposited\nunder NCBI BioProject accession numbers PRJNA439743\nthrough PRJNA439790.\nRESULTS\nMetabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates\nof B. distachyon\nMetabolomics analysis of lyophilized root exudates revealed\nthe presence of numerous plant metabolites, 86 of which were\nidentified by matching their spectra to the LECO/Fiehn\nMetabolomics library (Supplementary Table 3). These\nmetabolites included (i) carbohydrates and their derivatives\n(glucose, fructose, xylose, sucrose, trehalose, maltose, galactose,\nand others); (ii) sugar alcohols (b-mannosylglycerate, myoinositol,\ngalactinol, 2-deoxyerythritol, ribitol, threitol and\ncellobitol); (iii) amino acids and derivatives (glutamine,\ntyrosine, glutamic acid, asparagine, aspartic acid, valine,\nphenylalanine, isoleucine, glycine, serine, proline, leucine,\ntryptophan, cysteine, methionine, citrulline, and others); (iv)\norganic acids (aconitic, allantoic, g-aminobutyric, azelaic, citric,\nfumaric, 2-furoic, D-glyceric, 3-hydroxypropionic, a-ketoadipic,\nmalic, methylmalonic, nicotinic, quinic, succinic, threonic);\nand (v) assorted metabolites including heterocyclic compounds,\nphenolics, and biogenic amines, etc (3-hydroxypyridine,\nmaleimide, noradrenaline, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoate,\n5-methoxytryptamine, uracil, aminomalonic acid, palmitic acid,\nand urea). Results of the analysis also revealed that root exudates\nof B. distachyon contain hydroxyectoine and the quaternary\namine (QA) glycine betaine (Supplementary Figure 1).\nPhylogenetic and Pangenome Analyses\nof Pseudomonas Strains Used in the\nStudy\nWe used a set of phylogenetic markers suggested by Mulet et al.\n(2010) to investigate the relatedness of the eight strains used in\nthis study to distinct lineages recognized within the P. fluorescens\nspecies complex. The multilocus sequence analysis based on\nthe concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S\nrRNA), gyrB, rpoB, and rpoD identified R1-43-08 (along with\nstrains 2-79 and SBW25) as a member of the P. fluorescens\nsubgroup (Figure 1). The rest of the strains clustered closely with\nfour additional subgroups of the P. fluorescens complex, namely\nP. corrugata (strains Q2-87 and Q8r1-96), P. koreensis (Pf0-1),\nP. protegens (Pf-5), and P. chlororaphis (30–84). The genomes of\nthe eight rhizosphere Pseudomonas strains varied in size by 1.43\nmegabase (ranging from 5.65 to 7.07 Mb) and contained between\n5,166 and 6,363 protein-coding genes (Figure 2A). The shared\ngene content was characterized with OrthoMCL, which uses allagainst-\nall BLASTp followed by the Markov Cluster algorithm to\nidentify protein groups shared between the compared genomes,\nas well as groups representing species-specific gene expansion\nfamilies (Li et al., 2003). The pangenome analysis revealed a\ncore comprised of approximately 3,179 orthologs that were\nshared among all strains and represented 50.0% to 61.5%\nof each predicted proteome (Figures 2A,B). The non-core\npangenome contained genes shared by two or more (but not\nall) strains and contained between 1,482 and 2,080 orthologs,\nwhich corresponded to 28.7–36.3% of individual proteomes. The\nrest of the predicted protein-coding genes were strain-specific\nsingletons that comprised 7.5% to 15.1% of the strain’s predicted\nproteomes. In respect to divergence from the core genome, strain\nPf-5 was found to possess the highest proportion of unique genes\n(n = 949) followed by 2-79 (n = 887). The entire pangenome of\nthe Pseudomonas strains encompassed over 12,000 homolog and\nsingleton gene families.\nFurther homolog family-based comparisons identified Q8r1-\n96 and R1-43-08 as the most distantly related strains, with\n3349 shared homologs (Supplementary Table 4A). Q8r1-96 and\nQ2-87, which shared 4,489 homologs, were the most closely\nrelated strains. The partitioning of homolog gene families into\nthe core, non-core, and singleton parts of the pangenome agreed\nwith phylogenetic relationships of the strains deduced from the\nanalysis of a selected subset of COGs (Clusters of Orthologous\nGroups) (Figure 2C and Supplementary Tables 4B,C). The\nCOG-based phylogeny supported the multilocus sequence\nanalysis and revealed that the eight Pseudomonas strains form\nthree distinct clusters, the first of which contained 2-79, R1-30-\n84, and SBW25. The second cluster included Q8r1-96 and Q2-87,\nwhereas the third encompassed strains 30-84, Pf-5, and Pf0-1.\nCorrelating the Composition of Root\nExudates With Metabolic Profiles of\nPseudomonas Strains\nWe used the Phenotype MicroArray PM1 and PM2 plates to\nprofile the eight Pseudomonas strains for the utilization of\n190 different carbon sources. Results of the analysis identified\n90 compounds that supported growth and clustered by their\nintensities of utilization into three distinct groups (Figure 3).\nGroup I was comprised of 30 highly metabolized carbon\nsources, which included several amino acids and intermediates of\nglycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, and citrate cycle. Approximately\nhalf of these compounds were catabolized by all eight strains,\nand included several organic acids (fumaric, citric, gluconic,\nmalic, and pyroglutamic), amino acids (Glu, Asn, Gln, Asp, Pro,\nAla, and g-aminobutyric acid), carbohydrates (glucose, mannose,\nand mannitol), and the purine nucleoside inosine. Group II\nwas composed of 44 chemically diverse carbon sources that\nwere variably utilized by the strains. These compounds were\ncarbohydrates, organic acids, amino acids, phenolics, and polyols,\nand included known compatible solutes and intermediates of\nmetabolism of pentoses, galactose, starch, and sucrose. Group\nIII encompassed the rest of the Phenotype MicroArray test\npanel and contained compounds that were not catabolized\nby the tested strains. Among several notable exceptions were\na-hydroxyglutamic acid- g-lactone, putrescine, and itaconic,\ncitramalic, and succinamic acids, which supported the growth\nof strains 2-79, 30-84, Pf-5, and SBW25. We further matched\nthe carbon metabolic profiles of the Pseudomonas strains against\nthe list of plant-derived metabolites from the root exudates of\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 5 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nFIGURE 1 | Neighbor joining phylogeny showing the relationship of the eight strains used in this study (indicated by red triangles) to different species of the\nP. fluorescens complex. The phylogeny was established based on the concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S rRNA), gyrB (subunit B of DNA\ngyrase), rpoB (b subunit of RNA polymerase), and rpoD (sigma 70 factor subunit of RNA polymerase). Distance matrices were calculated by the Jukes-Cantor\nmethod. Colored circles on tree nodes indicate bootstrap values (1,000 replicates) that vary between 60% (smallest circle) and 100% (largest circles).\nB. distachyon Bd21. Interestingly, many carbon sources from\nthe Phenotype MicroArray panel were also present in the root\nexudates of B. distachyon Bd21, and some of these compounds\n(glucose, mannose, galactose, fructose, g-aminobutyric acid,\naspartic acid, citric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, quinic acid,\nalanine, glutamine, and glutamic acid) were catabolized by all\nstrains used in this study, while others (e.g., xylose, trehalose,\nm-inositol) were actively utilized only by certain organisms\n(Figure 3). The comparison of catabolic profiles across the\neight studied Pseudomonas strains revealed the presence of three\ndistinct clusters. The first cluster contained strains Q8r1-96 and\nQ2-87, which consumed very similar sets of carbon sources,\nas well as strain Pf0-1. The second cluster was composed of\n2-79, R1-43-08, SBW25, and 30-84, whereas the third cluster\nwas represented by a single strain, Pf-5. The overall similarity\nof the catabolic profiles partially agreed with the separation\nof the strains into different subgroups of the P. fluorescens\ncomplex (see above).\nAnalysis of the RNA-seq Results\nIn order to understand the cellular responses of rhizosphere\nPseudomonas to plant exometabolites, we analyzed the\ntranscriptome changes in cultures grown in the presence of\nroot exudates. Under field conditions, rhizobacteria colonize\nplant roots in the form of surface-attached microaerobic biofilms\n(Hojberg et al., 1999). To mimic these conditions, the eight\nPseudomonas strains were grown statically at 72% air saturation\nin 21C-glucose medium amended with root exudates and then\nprocessed to extract total RNA (Supplementary Figure 2).\nA total of 995 million raw sequencing reads were generated from\nthe RNA samples by using the Illumina HiSeq-2500 platform,\naveraging 20.7 million reads per sample. The removal of lowquality\nand rRNA sequences resulted in a total of 793 million\nfiltered reads that were mapped onto the eight Pseudomonas\ngenomes with a mean of 7.48 million mapped fragments per\ngenome. The differentially abundant transcripts were identified\nby setting a p value of 0.05 (adjusted for multiple testing) and\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 6 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

Box plots indicate the\n25th and 75th percentiles and medians (horizontal lines) with whiskers corresponding to the 10th and 90th percentiles. The input order was randomized to avoid any\nbias due to the sequential addition of new genomes. The pangenome size increases steadily without reaching a plateau even after the addition of 11,939\nnon-redundant gene families. At the same time, the core genome converged to 3,179 genes. (C) The pangenome-based phylogenomic analysis of the studied\nstrains. Here, the pangenome was defined with OrthoMCL, and orthologous gene sets were then partitioned into the core, singleton, and non-core (the remaining\northolog sets) categories. These categories were calculated for each node in the Maximum Likelihood species tree, using the set of genomes for which that node\nrepresents the ancestor. The results of the ortholog partitioning are shown in pie charts placed at tree nodes. Numbers indicate bootstrap support values. The\nanalysis was conducted in KBase (Arkin et al., 2018).\nthe log2 fold-change (FC) threshold \u2000\u2000 2.0 (Figure 4 and\nSupplementary Tables 5–12). When compared with the control\nconditions, an average of 204 genes per strain were differentially\nexpressed in the presence of root exudates, with the highest\n(n = 425) and lowest (n = 112) numbers observed, respectively,\nin SBW25 and Q2-87 (Figure 4). Overall, more genes were\ninduced than repressed in response to exudates, but the actual\nnumbers in each category varied substantially depending on the\nidentity of the Pseudomonas strain. In most strains, the bulk of\nthe differentially expressed genes was almost equally distributed\nbetween the core (mean, 48.2%) and non-core (mean, 45.8%)\nparts of the genome, whereas the strain-specific singleton genes\nconstituted on average only 5.9% (Figure 4B). One notable\nexception was observed in Q8r1-96, where all differentially\nexpressed genes belonged to the core (73.8%) and non-core\n(26.2%) parts of the genome. Another notable pattern was\nobserved in R1-43-08, where the majority of genes affected by\nthe presence of root exudate fell into the non-core category\n(56.3%). The highest proportion of differentially expressed\nsingletons (11.3 and 10.4%, respectively) was identified in\nstrains SBW25 and Pf-5.\nWe further explored how the identified differentially\nexpressed genes were distributed across genomes of the eight\nstudied rhizosphere strains. The pairwise BLASTp comparisons\nidentified 2-79 and SBW25 as two strains that shared the highest\nnumber of genes (n = 101) induced or repressed in response\nto root exudates (Table 1). The second pair of strains with\na significant number of similar differentially expressed genes\n(n = 86) was Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, which was followed by Pf0-1\nand 30-84, which shared 56 differentially expressed genes. These\npatterns of shared genes were also observed when the results of\nthe pairwise BLASTp comparisons were converted into a binary\ngene presence/absence matrix, which was then subjected to\ncluster analysis using a UPGMA algorithm based on Sorensen’s\ndissimilarity index or examined by non-metric multidimensional\nscaling (NMDS) (Figure 5).\nThe differentially expressed Pseudomonas genes were\nsubjected to Blast2Go analysis and Gene Ontology (GO)\nannotation (Figure 6). Metabolic process, catalytic activity,\nand membrane were the most common annotation terms\nacross the three primary GO term categories (i.e., biological\nprocess, molecular function, and cellular component). A total\nof 1,694 GO terms was assigned to 805 upregulated genes, with\nthe majority of the GO terms related to molecular function\n(682, 40.3%), followed by biological process (669, 39.5%), and\ncellular component (343, 20.2%). In the 539 downregulated gene\ncategory, 1,101 GO terms were assigned to biological process\n(420, 38.1%), molecular function (417, 37.9%), and cellular\ncomponent (264, 24.0%). Within biological process, metabolic\nprocess, cellular process, localization, response to stimulus, and\nregulation were over-represented. Within molecular function,\nthe largest proportion was assigned to catalytic activity, binding,\nand transporter activity categories. Within cellular component,\nthe majority were assigned to membrane, membrane part, cell,\nand cell part categories. Across the eight strains, 37–42% of\ndifferentially expressed genes had no Gene Ontology IDs and\nencoded various conserved hypothetical proteins.\nFunctional Classification of Shared\nDifferentially Expressed Genes\nThe interrogation of RNA-seq data revealed multiple cellular\npathways that were differentially regulated in bacterial cultures\nincubated with root exudates (Supplementary Figures 3, 4).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 7 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nFIGURE 3 | Biolog Phenotype MicroArray profiling the eight rhizosphere\nPseudomonas strains used in the study. The hierarchical clustering analysis\nwas carried out using the average linkage method with Euclidean distances.\nCarbon sources identified by red arrowheads were also detected in the sterile\nroot exudates of B. distachyon Bd21.\nAlthough none of these differentially regulated pathways were\nshared by all eight strains, the cross-strain comparisons revealed\nseveral types of common and specific transcriptomic responses\nthat were elicited by the presence of plant exometabolites\n(Table 2). The visual representation of core gene expression\npatterns is provided in Supplementary Figure 5, which\nshows heatmaps of expression profiles and p-adj values for\ncore genes shared by the studied strains. The figure is\naccompanied by Supplementary Table 13 that lists predicted\nfunctions of genes constituting the four distinct clusters\nobserved after hierarchical clustering of gene expression\nvalues. The first category of shared differentially expressed\npathways functioned in the uptake and catabolism of selected\ncarbohydrates, quaternary ammonium compounds (QAs), and\nphenolics. All strains except for R1-43-08, responded to root\nexudates by inducing the fructose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate\n(PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTSFru). The\ncomponents of this system are encoded by a conserved\noperon and include the cytoplasmic polyprotein EI/HPr/EIIAFru\n(FruB), the 1-phosphofructokinase FruK, and the fructosespecific\npermease EIIBC (FruA) (Chavarria et al., 2016). The\nPTSFru system functions by acquiring high-energy phosphates\nfrom PEP and sequentially passing them, via the EI/HPr/EIIAFru\ndomains of FruB, to the EIIB component of FruA. The\nphosphates are ultimately transferred by the EIIC transporter\nto fructose yielding fructose 1-phosphate, which is channeled\ninto the central metabolic pathways through the action of the\nphosphofructokinase FruK.\nIn all strains except for Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, the exposure to root\nexudates resulted in the induction of two genes adjacent to the\nfru cluster that encoded a Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS)\ntransporter and an L-arabinonate dehydratase (Table 2). These\ngenes are predicted to participate in the uptake and catabolism\nof L-arabinose, where L-arabinonate dehydratase plays an\nimportant role by converting L-arabinonate to 2-dehydro-3-\ndeoxy-L-arabinonate (Rahman et al., 2017). In SBW25, R1-\n43-08, and Q2-87, we also observed the induction of genes\nencoding components of the AraFGH complex, an ATP-Binding\nCassette (ABC) superfamily transporter involved in the import of\narabinose into the cell (Supplementary Tables 6, 7, 9). Finally, all\nstrains except SBW25 and R1-43-08 responded to the presence\nof exudates by upregulating a conserved gene encoding an\naldose epimerase superfamily protein. Such enzymes equilibrate\nalpha- and beta-anomers of aldoses and ensure that stereospecific\nenzymes involved in the metabolism of free sugars do not act as\nmetabolic bottlenecks (Abayakoon et al., 2018). Although some\naldose epimerases have been linked to specific pathways, the\nPseudomonas gene identified in this study could not be assigned\nto a particular metabolic process based on sequence analysis and\ngenomic location.\nSeveral Pseudomonas strains responded to the presence\nof root exudates by upregulating genes involved in the\nuptake and catabolism of myo-inositol and possibly other\nstereoisomers of inositol (Table 2). The upregulated catabolic\ngenes encode the dehydrogenase IolG, which oxidizes myoinositol\nto its corresponding ketone, as well as IolE, IolD, IolB,\nand IolC that collectively convert the 2-keto-myo-inositol to\nacetyl-CoA and the glycolysis intermediate dihydroxyacetone\nphosphate (Yoshida et al., 2008; Kohler et al., 2011). In R1-\n43-08, Q8r1-96, Q2-87, and Pf-5, the upregulated functions\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 8 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

The cross-genome comparisons revealed\nthat in all studied strains except for Pf0-1, components\nof the myo-inositol utilization pathway were encoded\nwithin a well-conserved gene cluster which, in addition to\ncatabolic and transport functions, also encodes a dedicated\ntranscriptional repressor.\nAll studied strains of Pseudomonas carry multiple genes\ninvolved in scavenging the quaternary ammonium compounds\ncholine, glycine betaine (GB), carnitine, choline-O-sulfate, and\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 9 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

Many of these genes were\ndifferentially expressed, including those encoding parts of the\nABC transporter CbcXWV, which is predicted to function in\nthe uptake of choline under water-replete conditions (Table 2).\nAmong enzymes induced in the presence of root exudates were\nthe choline dehydrogenase BetA, which converts choline to\nglycine betaine and a network of enzymes (i.e., the Rieske family\noxygenase GbcAB, the dimethyglycine demethylase DgcAB, and\nthe sarcosine oxidase SoxBDAG) that sequentially convert GB\nto glycine. In 2-79 and SBW25, this group of differentially\nregulated genes also included an AraC-family transcriptional\nactivator GbdR, which perceives intercellular levels of GB and\ninduces genes involved in the transport and catabolism of\nglycine betaine and detoxification of the catabolic byproducts\n(Hampel et al., 2014).\nThe last category of activated catabolic pathways included the\ncatechol branch of the b-ketoadipate pathway for the degradation\nof aromatic compounds. In strains 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5,\ngrowth on root exudates resulted in upregulation of catechol-\n1,2-dioxygenase, muconate cycloisomerase, and muconolactone\nisomerase, which collectively cleave the catechol ring and\nconvert it to b-ketoadipate enol-lactone (Harwood and Parales,\n1996). Finally, analysis of the P. synxantha 2-79 transcriptome\nidentified an induction of benABC genes encoding subunits\nof benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase, an oxidoreductase that generates\ncatechol from benzoate.\nIn addition to various catabolic pathways, the exposure to root\nexudates also induced several genes involved in the homeostasis\nof copper (Table 2). Four of these genes form a conserved cluster\nin genomes of the strains and encode the periplasmic coppersensing\ntwo-component system CinRS, the plastocyanin/azurinlike\nprotein CinA, and the NADPH-dependent pre-Q0 reductase\nCinQ. Also, in strains Q2-87, 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, we observed\nupregulation of a conserved operon encoding the multicopper\noxidase CopA, the periplasmic copper-binding protein CopC, the\ninner membrane protein CopD, and outer membrane protein\nCopB. In several Gram-negative bacteria, these Cop proteins are\nthought to have dual functions and participate both in the uptake\nof essential copper as well as in the sequestration of excess copper\nin the periplasm and outer membrane.\nThe analysis of shared downregulated pathways revealed that\nmost of the strains respond to the presence of root exudates by\nrepressing genes involved in the uptake and catabolism of sulfur\ncompounds (Table 2). In strains SBW25, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96,\nQ2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, this response involved the ssuEADCB\noperon responsible for the utilization of alkanesulfonates\nas sulfur sources. The ssu operon is highly conserved in\nfluorescent pseudomonads and encodes the FMNH2-dependent\nmonooxygenase SsuD and the NAD (P)H-dependent FMN\nreductase SsuE, which together catalyze the desulfonation of\nalkanesulfonates. Also, the ssu locus contains genes for the\nmolybdopterin-binding protein SsuF and the alkanesulfonatespecific\nABC-type transporter consisting of the sulfonate\nsubstrate-binding protein SsuA, sulfonate permease protein\nSsuC, and sulfonate transport ATP-binding protein SsuB. Finally,\nin R1-43-08, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, growth on root exudates\ncoincided with repression of the tauABCD operon, which\nallows these strains to utilize taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonate)\nas a sulfur source. The repressed tau genes encoded the\n2-oxoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenase TauD and\nsubstrate-binding, ATP-binding, and permease components of\nthe taurine-specific ABC transporter TauABC.\nOther Differentially Expressed Pathways\nIn addition to their effect on several shared cellular pathways,\ngrowth on root exudates resulted in the induction or repression of\nnumerous strain-specific genes. In closely related P. synxantha 2-\n79 and P. fluorescens SBW25, we observed differential expression\nof genes involved in energy metabolism, transport of amino\nacids, and surface attachment (Supplementary Tables 5, 6).\nOther notable differentially expressed pathways included 2–\n79 gene clusters that encode enzymes for the catabolism of\ntrehalose, a prophage, and toxin/antitoxin system, as well as the\nSBW25 operon predicted to control the synthesis of the capsular\nexopolysaccharide colonic acid. The response of Pseudomonas sp.\nR1-43-08 to root exudates also involved differential expression\nof different energy metabolism pathways. In addition, we\nobserved the upregulation of genes involved in the uptake and\ncatabolism of xylose (also upregulated in 2–79) and repression\nof enzymes for the biosynthesis of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid\nand assimilation of inorganic sulfur and L-cysteine biosynthesis\n(Supplementary Table 7).\nThe analysis of the Q8r1-96 transcriptome revealed\nperturbation of different metabolic pathways including genes\nencoding components of cytochrome C oxidase, transport\nand catabolism of sorbitol/mannitol, metabolism of butanoic\nacid, and biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides alginate and\npoly-b-1-6-N-acetylglucosamine (Supplementary Table 8). In\nP. fluorescens Q2-87, we identified differential expression of\ngenes involved in metabolism of galactose, tryptophan, tyrosine,\nglycine, serine, and threonine (Supplementary Table 9),\nwhile in P. chlororaphis 30-84, growth on exudates activated\nthe biosynthesis of molybdopterin cofactor, catabolism of\ngalactonate and acetoin, and uptake and catabolism of putrescine\n(Supplementary Table 10). The response of P. protegens Pf-5 to\nroot exudates involved upregulation of acetoin dehydrogenase,\nwhich converts acetoin to acetaldehyde and acetyl-CoA, as\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 10 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

The terms were derived from 93 different functional groups (GO subcategories level 4). The GO terms were assigned with Blast2GO (Conesa\nand Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al., 2018). On a WEGO histogram, the percentage of 100 is defined as the total number of genes assigned a GO\nterm. However, the subcategories do not add up to 100% because many genes fall into more than one functional class and are therefore annotated by multiple GO\nterms.\nwell as pathways for the utilization of glycolate and putrescine\n(Supplementary Table 11). Also induced were genes for\nthe production of pyrrolnitrin and PhlG hydrolase, which\nmodulate the metabolic loads attributed to the synthesis of\n2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol. The differentially expressed genes of\nP. fluorescens Pf0-1 included, among others, operons encoding\ncytochrome C oxidase and enzymes for catabolism of malonic\nacid (Supplementary Table 12). Yet another interesting\nfinding involved the induction of assorted genes acting in the\nhomeostasis of iron and defense against reactive oxygen species\n(ROS). We observed activation of iron dicitrate transporters\n(SBW25 and 30-84), genes for the biosynthesis of siderophores\nornicorrugatin (SBW25) and pyochelin (Pf-5), heme-degrading\nenzymes (2–79, 30–84), TonB siderophore receptors, and\ncomponents of the energy-transducing inner membrane\ncomplex TonB-ExbB-ExbD (2–79 and Pf-5). The differentially\nexpressed ROS defense pathways were represented by different\ncatalases in strains 2–79, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and\nPf-5 and organic hydroperoxide resistance proteins in strains\nSBW25 and R1-43-08.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nsoil microorganisms. Our results were in agreement with a\nrecent report of 27 different sugars, amino acids, and organic\nacids in Brachypodium exudates (Kawasaki et al., 2016). We\nconfirmed the presence of exometabolites identified in that\nstudy, along with dozens of additional analytes that were\nidentified by matching their mass-spectra and retention indices\nto the LECO/Fiehn Metabolomics library (Supplementary\nTable 3). The complementation of the metabolomic analysis\nwith profiling of the bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays\nrevealed that a substantial proportion of the characterized\nexudate constituents were catabolized by a collection of eight\nPseudomonas strains from across the P. fluorescens group that is\nknown to form associations with plant roots. The amendment\nof Pseudomonas cultures with root exudates caused changes in\nthe expression of multiple genes encoding catabolic and anabolic\nenzymes, predicted transporters, transcriptional regulators, stress\nresponse, and conserved hypothetical proteins. In most strains,\nthese differentially expressed genes were almost equally split\nbetween the core and variable genome regions, mirroring\nthe substantial strain-to-strain variation in the genome size\nand gene content within the P. fluorescens species complex\n(Loper et al., 2012).\nThe analysis of transcriptome responses to root exudates\nrevealed several types of cellular pathways present in the strains\nused in this study. The first category of such pathways was\ninvolved in the catabolism of carbohydrates such as fructose,\narabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, trehalose, and galactose. Among\nthese catabolic traits, the ability to utilize fructose as a carbon\nsource is highly conserved among fluorescent pseudomonads.\nIn contrast, growth on arabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, and\ntrehalose is variably present and was traditionally used to\ndifferentiate species and biovars within the P. fluorescens\ngroup (Barrett et al., 1986). We speculate that such variably\ndistributed pathways contribute to the differential affinity of\npseudomonads toward host plants and/or to determine which\nstrains flourish in response to growing roots and changing\nenvironments. Several independent studies have confirmed\nthe importance of carbohydrate catabolism pathways for the\nbiology of rhizosphere pseudomonads. For example, in vivo\nexpression technology (IVET) profiling of P. fluorescens SBW25\nidentified xylose isomerase among genome regions essential\nfor the colonization of sugar beet seedlings (Liu et al., 2015),\nwhereas a genome-wide Tn-Seq screen of Pseudomonas simiae\nidentified genes for the catabolism of myo-inositol among traits\nessential for the colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana roots\n(Cole et al., 2017).\nThe response of rhizosphere Pseudomonas to Brachypodium\nroot exudates also involved pathways for the uptake and\nmetabolism of amino acids. We observed differential\nexpression of genes encoding the hydrophobic (HAAT) and\npolar (PAAT) amino acid uptake transporters in strains\n2-79, SBW25, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5. Other related genes\nencoded enzymes for the catabolism of valine and glutamic\nacid (2-79); metabolism of tryptophan, glycine, serine, and\nthreonine (Q2-87); and biosynthesis of methionine (Q8r1-\n96). It is plausible that the abundance of amino acids in\nroot exudates is also linked to the repression of pathways\ninvolved in the catabolism of sulfonates and taurine that\nwas observed in several strains (Table 2). Although the\npreferred source of sulfur for P. fluorescens is unknown, in the\nclosely related P. aeruginosa, the sulfur starvation response\nis triggered by the growth on any sulfur compound other\nthan sulfate, thiocyanate, and cysteine (Hummerjohann et al.,\n1998). This fact, together with the presence of cysteine and\ncystine in the root exudates, suggest that root exudates of\nBrachypodium may serve as an important source of sulfur for\nrhizosphere Pseudomonas. These findings also agree well with\nthe reported scarcity of inorganic sulfate in the soil, and the\npresence of sulfur mostly in the form of organic compounds,\nincluding amino acids, proteins, sulfate esters, and sulfonates\n(Autry and Fitzgerald, 1990).\nAnother interesting result of this study was the concerted\nactivation of copper and iron homeostasis pathways observed\nin all of the Pseudomonas strains used in this work. In bacteria,\nan excess of copper is toxic and triggers oxidative stress due to\nthe formation of free radicals, as well as disruption of protein\nmetalation and stability of iron-sulfur clusters (Bondarczuk\nand Piotrowska-Seget, 2013). On the other hand, copper is an\nessential trace element used as a cofactor in different enzymes.\nSimilarly, although elevated levels of iron cause redox stress, this\nelement is also found in active energy metabolism enzymes and is\ncrucial for bacterial growth (Andrews et al., 2003). The analysis\nof metal homeostasis genes identified in this study suggests\nthat their induction was likely triggered by the deficiency of\ncopper and iron in bacterial cultures grown in the presence of\nroot exudates. We attribute this effect to the ability of some\ncomponents of root exudates to chelate soil metals.\nDespite the abundance of iron in the soil, its bioavailability\nis limited due to the low solubility of Fe (III) oxyhydrates\nat neutral pH. The non-graminaceous plants circumvent this\nproblem by acidifying the rhizosphere and secreting flavins,\nphenolics, and organic acids that chelate iron. The reduction\nof these ferric chelates releases soluble ferrous iron taken up\nby root cells (Kobayashi and Nishizawa, 2012). Graminaceous\nplants, like Brachypodium, acquire iron by secreting into the\nsoil non-protein amino acids of the mugineic acid (MA) group,\nwhich act as Fe (III)-chelating phytosiderophores. In addition to\niron, low-molecular-weight organic acids and phytosiderophores\nbind other divalent and trivalent metals (including copper) and\ncontribute to heavy-metal tolerance in plants (Chen et al., 2017).\nIt is plausible that the presence of these plant exometabolites\nis responsible for the deficit of iron and copper observed in\nPseudomonas cultures grown in the presence of root exudates.\nThese results further underscore the importance of diverse and\nredundant metal homeostasis pathways found in genomes of the\nP. fluorescens group for the ability of these organisms to colonize\nand persist in the plant rhizosphere.\nRecently, Klonowska et al. (2018) examined transcriptomic\nresponses of symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria to root\nexudates of the legume plant Mimosa pundica, which has\nan unusual ability to support both alpha- (Rhizobium) and\nbeta-rhizobia (Cupriavidus and Burkholderia). Using RNA-seq,\nthe authors characterized genes involved in the perception of\nroot exudates in the nodulating bacteria Burkholderia phymatum\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 14 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nSTM815, Cupriavidus taiwanensis LMG19424, and Rhizobium\nmesoamericanum STM3625. Interestingly, the analysis of\ndifferentially expressed genes revealed induction of pathways\ninvolved in the catabolism of fructose, xylose, myo-inositol,\nand protocatechuate/catechol. Also upregulated were some\ncopper homeostasis, siderophore biosynthesis, and oxidative\nstress genes. Finally, the analytical profiling of M. pundica\nexudates revealed an overlap with Brachypodium in the types of\ncarbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids present. These\nfindings suggest that differentially expressed genes shared by\nmultiple strains of the group P. fluorescens are not unique to\nthe Brachypodium-Pseudomonas system but represent a set\nof conserved cellular pathways involved in the perception of\nplant exometabolites by different clades of rhizosphere-dwelling\nProteobacteria.\nMost strains included in this study were originally selected\nbased on the ability to colonize the rhizosphere and produce\nsecondary metabolites that alleviate the plant stress response\nand/or inhibit soilborne pathogens. It has been suggested\nthat plant metabolites released into the rhizosphere affect\nthe biocontrol activity of plant-beneficial pseudomonads (de\nWerra et al., 2011). We provide further support to this\nhypothesis by demonstrating that in some strains, root exudates\nmodulate the expression of genes for the catabolism of\nthe plant growth-promoting metabolites acetoin and 2,3-\nbutanediol. The exposure to exudates also affected the expression\nof genes for the synthesis of well-characterized antifungal\ncompounds pyrrolnitrin, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, and 2,4-\ndiacetylphloroglucinol. The modulatory effects were strainspecific,\nsuggesting significant differences in the regulatory\nnetworks involved in the perception of plant signals and\nregulation of the production of antibiotics and growthpromoting\nmetabolites.\nThe final significant finding of this study was the induction\nof catabolism of quaternary amines (QAs) observed in multiple\nstrains of the P. fluorescens group during growth on root\nexudates. This observation was supported by the detection of\nglycine betaine in the root secretions of B. distachyon. The\npresence of QAs in plant tissues and the capacity of these\nmetabolites to provide stress protection and nutrients to plant\npathogens and symbionts were reported before (Boncompagni\net al., 1999; Chen et al., 2013; Kabbadj et al., 2017), but our\nstudy is among the first to highlight the potential importance of\nthese metabolites for rhizosphere interactions. Pseudomonads do\nnot synthesize QAs de novo but have evolved many pathways to\nscavenge them from eukaryotic hosts, where these metabolites\nare abundant due to the prominence of phosphatidylcholine\nin cellular membranes. Strains of P. fluorescens carry genes\nfor the conversion of choline, carnitine, and glycine betaine to\nglycine, as well as quaternary amine transporters of the BCCT\nand ABC families that are also conserved in the opportunistic\nhuman pathogen P. aeruginosa and the plant pathogen P. syringae\n(Galvao et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2013; Wargo, 2013b).\nIn P. aeruginosa, choline catabolism genes are essential for\nthe ability of this pathogen to persist during lung infection\n(Wargo, 2013a). Similarly, a P. syringae mutant deficient in\nBetT, OpuC, and CbcXWV quaternary amine transporters had\nreduced fitness during colonization of bean and soybean leaves\nunder greenhouse and field conditions (Chen et al., 2013).\nDepending on water availability, P. aeruginosa and P. syringae\ncatabolize exogenously supplied QAs as carbon and nitrogen\nsources or accumulate them as osmoprotectants (Chen et al.,\n2013; Wargo, 2013b). Our ongoing work in P. synxantha 2–\n79 unraveled similar physiological responses and demonstrated\nthat QA transporters function differentially and redundantly\nin the uptake of quaternary amines as nutrients (Pablo and\nMavrodi, unpublished). In contrast, under water stress, the QAs\ncholine, betaine, and carnitine are accumulated preferentially for\nosmoprotection. Under drought stress, a 2–79 mutant devoid\nof all known QA transporters was less competitive in the\ncolonization of the Brachypodium rhizosphere than its wild-type\nparental strain. Interestingly, our metabolomic profiling of root\nexudates also revealed proline, glutamine, and hydroxyectoine.\nThese metabolites act as compatible solutes in different groups\nof microorganisms (Yancey et al., 1982; Empadinhas and da\nCosta, 2008), suggesting an important role of root exudates\nin the ability of Pseudomonas to persist in the rhizosphere of\ndrought-stressed plants.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe original contributions presented in the study are publicly\navailable.

Plant roots secrete carbon-rich rhizodeposits containing primary and\nsecondary low molecular weight metabolites, lysates, and mucilages. These exudates\nprovide nutrients for soil microorganisms and modulate their affinity to host plants, but\nmolecular details of this process are largely unresolved. We addressed this gap by\nfocusing on the molecular dialog between eight well-characterized beneficial strains\nof the Pseudomonas fluorescens group and Brachypodium distachyon, a model for\neconomically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops of the grass family. We\ncollected and analyzed root exudates of B. distachyon and demonstrated the presence\nof multiple carbohydrates, amino acids, organic acids, and phenolic compounds. The\nsubsequent screening of bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays revealed that many\nof these metabolites provide carbon and energy for the Pseudomonas strains. RNAseq\nprofiling of bacterial cultures amended with root exudates revealed changes in the\nexpression of genes encoding numerous catabolic and anabolic enzymes, transporters,\ntranscriptional regulators, stress response, and conserved hypothetical proteins. Almost\nhalf of the differentially expressed genes mapped to the variable part of the strains’\npangenome, reflecting the importance of the variable gene content in the adaptation of\nP. fluorescens to the rhizosphere lifestyle. Our results collectively reveal the diversity\nof cellular pathways and physiological responses underlying the establishment of\nmutualistic interactions between these beneficial rhizobacteria and their plant hosts.\nKeywords: Pseudomonas, Brachypodium, rhizosphere, root exudates, transcriptome\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 1 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nINTRODUCTION\nPlants are meta-organisms or holobionts that rely in part on\ntheir microbiome for specific functions and traits. The ability\nof the plant microbiome to influence plant development, vigor,\nhealth, and fitness in response to abiotic stressors associated\nwith global climate change is documented by numerous studies\n(Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009). There is mounting evidence\nthat plants actively recruit beneficial microbiomes, but many\naspects of this process are still very much a black box (Reinhold-\nHurek et al., 2015). The foundation for the differential affinity\nof rhizobacteria toward host plants is built upon complex\nchemical cross talk between microorganisms and plant roots.\nUp to 40% of photosynthetically fixed carbon is released by\nplant roots in the form of exudates and secretions, lysates, and\nmucilages (Curl and Truelove, 1986; Lynch, 1990; Whipps, 1990;\nBadri and Vivanco, 2009). The release of these compounds is\nactively controlled in response to environmental stimuli, and the\ncomposition of root exudates varies greatly according to plant\nspecies and physiological condition (Lynch, 1990; Nguyen, 2003;\nPhillips et al., 2004; De-la-Pena et al., 2008). The presence and\ncomposition of exudates strongly impact soil microorganisms,\nwhich is consistent with the idea that plants actively select and\nshape their root microbiota (Zolla et al., 2013).\nPrimary root exudates include simple and complex sugars,\namino acids, polypeptides and proteins, organic, aliphatic and\nfatty acids, sterols, and phenolics (Nguyen, 2003; Badri and\nVivanco, 2009; Badri et al., 2009). These compounds serve as\ncarbon and energy sources for rhizobacteria, and the presence\nof the intact corresponding catabolic pathways is essential\nfor competitive colonization of roots and disease suppression\n(Lugtenberg et al., 2001; Kamilova et al., 2005; Lugtenberg and\nKamilova, 2009). Root exudates also contain numerous signal\nmolecules and secondary metabolites, the significance of which\nis only now emerging (Walker et al., 2003; Bais et al., 2005,\n2006). A handful of analyses of plant-induced gene expression\nby transcriptional profiling in vitro (Mark et al., 2005) or in\nthe rhizosphere (Silby and Levy, 2004; Ramos-Gonzalez et al.,\n2005; Matilla et al., 2007; Barret et al., 2009) have identified\nmultiple genes that are differentially regulated by exposure to\nroots or root exudates. Bacterial pathways expressed during\nrhizosphere colonization control utilization of plant-derived\nmetabolites (Simons et al., 1996, 1997; Camacho-Carvajal, 2001;\nLugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), motility and chemotaxis (de\nWeert et al., 2002; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), phase\nvariation (Dekkers et al., 1998; Sanchez-Contreras et al., 2002;\nvan den Broek et al., 2005), outer membrane integrity (de Weert\net al., 2006; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), and the ability\nto sequester limiting resources (Raaijmakers et al., 1995) and\nresist environmental stresses (Sarniguet et al., 1995; Miller and\nWood, 1996; van Veen et al., 1997; Schnider-Keel et al., 2001). In\nits spatial and temporal properties, root colonization resembles\nbiofilm formation, and biofilm-related pathways also have been\nimplicated in adhesion to seeds and roots and rhizosphere\ncolonization (Espinosa-Urgel et al., 2000; Hinsa et al., 2003;\nYousef-Coronado et al., 2008; Fuqua, 2010; Martinez-Gil et al.,\n2010; Nielsen et al., 2011; Zboralski and Filion, 2020). Finally,\nroot exudates strongly affect the expression of diverse plant\ngrowth promotion and biocontrol genes (Vacheron et al., 2013).\nOver the past decade, the genomes of numerous rhizosphere\nstrains have been sequenced and analyzed, but functional\ngenomics studies of rhizosphere competence lag behind the\navailability of sequence data.\nThis study explored the molecular dialog between the\nmodel host plant Brachypodium distachyon and several wellcharacterized\nrhizosphere strains of the Pseudomonas fluorescens\ngroup. Brachypodium is a small annual grass originating in semiarid\nregions of the Middle East that has emerged as a prime model\nfor economically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops\nof the grass family (Bevan et al., 2010; Schwartz et al., 2010;\nBrkljacic et al., 2011; Hong et al., 2011; Tyler et al., 2014). The\nbiology, extensive collection of resources, and research tools\nmake B. distachyon an attractive model to investigate interactions\nbetween plants and root-associated microbes. Pseudomonads\nare ubiquitous Gram-negative g-proteobacteria that colonize\neukaryotic hosts and include both commensals and economically\nimportant pathogens of plants and animals (Moore et al.,\n2006; Schroth et al., 2006; Yahr and Parsek, 2006). The genus\nPseudomonas currently comprises > 100 named species that have\nbeen separated based on multilocus sequence analysis into 14\nspecies groups (Garrido-Sanz et al., 2016; Hesse et al., 2018).\nThe P. fluorescens group is the most diverse regarding both\nthe genetic distances within it, the number of species and the\nlarge pangenome that makes up > 50% of the pangenome\nof the genus as a whole (Loper et al., 2012). The group also\nencompasses an unusually high proportion of strains that inhabit\nthe plant rhizosphere and possess plant growth promoting and\nbiocontrol properties. Naylor et al. (2017) profiled bacterial\ncommunities associated with root tissues and rhizosphere of\n18 different plant species of the Poaceae family. That study\nidentified Pseudomonas among taxa constituting the core grass\nroot microbiome and demonstrated that these bacteria were\nenriched in C3 plants, including wheat, rye, barley, oat, and\nBrachypodium. We confirmed the capacity of B. distachyon\nBd21 to serve as a host for rhizobacteria of the P. fluorescens\ngroup in preliminary greenhouse assays with biocontrol strains\nP. synxantha 2-79, P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96, and P. protegens\nPf-5. Results of these experiments revealed that all strains\nsuccessfully established and colonized the roots of Brachypodium\n(Supplementary Table 1).\nIn this study, we focused on eight well-studied strains\nof the P. fluorescens complex that are supported by years\nof studies, numerous refereed publications, and high-quality\ngenome sequences. By profiling transcriptomes of these strains\nduring growth in root exudates of B. distachyon, we revealed the\ndiversity of cellular pathways and physiological responses that\nunderlie the establishment of mutualistic interactions between\nbeneficial rhizobacteria and the host plant. Our results also\nconfirmed that root exudates contain carbohydrates, amino acids,\norganic acids, and phenolics that serve as carbon and energy\nsources for rhizobacteria. The root exudates also contained\nosmoprotectants that may help microorganisms to persist in the\nrhizosphere of drought-stressed plants.

R1-43-08 (Parejko\net al., 2012), P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96 (Raaijmakers and Weller,\n1998), P. fluorescens Q2-87 (Bangera and Thomashow, 1996),\nP. chlororaphis 30-84 (Thomashow et al., 1990), P. fluorescens\nPf0-1 (Silby et al., 2009), and P. protegens Pf-5 (Howell and\nStipanovic, 1980). The selected organisms have been studied\nextensively for their role in biological control and plant\ngrowth promotion (Supplementary Table 2). The strains were\nmaintained in the laboratory as frozen stocks (\U0010000080\u2000C) and\nroutinely cultured in King’s medium B (King et al., 1954) or\n21C medium, which contained (per 1 L): 1.0 g of NH4Cl, 3.5 g\nof Na2HPO4\u20002H2O, 2.8 g of KH2PO4, 3.0 g of glucose, and\n20 ml of a microelement solution (Smibert and Kreig, 1994;\nHalverson and Firestone, 2000).\nPropagation of Plants and Collection of\nRoot Exudates\nB. distachyon Bd21 was established from seed material obtained\nfrom the USDA-ARS Plant Germplasm Introduction and Testing\nResearch Unit (Pullman, WA, United States). Brachypodium\nseeds were imbibed for 3 days at 4\u2000C and sown in 7 \u2000 7 cm\npots filled with Sunshine Potting Mix #4 (Sun Gro Horticulture,\nAgawam, MA, United States). Plants were grown in an IR-\n89X (Percival Scientific, Perry, IA, United States) controlled\nenvironment chamber retrofitted with 6500K and 3000K T5 54W\ngrow lights (Spectralux) under a 20-h light, 24\u2000C/4-h dark, 18\u2000C\ncycle. Plants were watered and fertilized with Jack’s professional\nwater-soluble fertilizer (20:20:20) (JR Peters, Allentown, PA,\nUnited States). After 12 weeks and plant senescence, seeds\nwere collected, processed, and stored under desiccant and dark\nconditions at room temperature.\nTo collect root exudates, seeds of B. distachyon Bd21 were\nsurface-sterilized, pregerminated, and placed in sterile 1 L widemouth\nglass jars containing 113 g of 6-mm glass beads and\n25 ml distilled water. Jars were covered with vented caps\nand plants were grown hydroponically in an environmental\ncontrolled growth chamber under conditions described above.\nAfter 6 days, root exudates were extracted from individual\njars and their sterility was confirmed by spotting on nutrient\nagar. Multiple batches of root exudates were collected, filtered\n(0.22 mm), aliquoted in Falcon tubes (10 ml), lyophilized, and\nstored at –80\u2000C.\nMetabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates\nExudates were analyzed for primary metabolites at the Murdock\nMetabolomics Laboratory at Washington State University\n(Pullman, WA, United States). Freeze-dried residues were\nsuspended in 500 ml 50% aqueous acetonitrile and clarified by\ncentrifugation for 20 min at 21,000 \u2000 g and 4\u2000C. The liquid\nchromatography mass spectrometry analysis was conducted\nwith a Synapt G2-S quadrupole-ion mobility spectrometrytime\nof flight mass spectrometer system equipped with an\nacquity ultra-performance liquid chromatograph (UPLC) and\nan acquity photodiode array detector (all from Waters, Milford,\nMA, United States). The exudate metabolites were separated\non a SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC HPLC column (2.1 \u2000 100 mm,\n3 mm) (Milllipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, United States) using\nacetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid as solvent B and water\nwith 0.1% formic acid as solvent A at a flow rate of 400 ml\nmin\U001000001 and the following linear gradient extending over 14 min:\n0 min, 80% B; 4 min, 80% B, 6 min: 10% B; 7.5 min, 10%\nB; 10 min, 80% B; and 14 min, 80% B. Mass spectra were\ncollected in positive ion mode over a range of m/z 50–1,200\nwith a scan time of 0.2 s. The Q-TOF-MS source was at\n3.0 kV and 120\u2000C; the sampling cone at 40 V, desolvation\ntemperature was 250\u2000C; cone gas and desolvation gas flow were\nat 0 and 850 L h\U001000001, respectively. Leucine enkephalin was used\nfor post-acquisition mass correction. Target compounds were\nvisualized using selected ion chromatograms at 0.05 Da window\nwidth. The compound identification was based on comparison\nof chromatographic behavior and accurate masses to those of\nauthentic standards.\nFor gas chromatography, derivatization was carried out using\na modification of the procedure of Lee and Fiehn (2008).\nThe freeze-dried residues were suspended in 950 ml aqueous\nmethanol (84%, v/v) and clarified by centrifugation for 15 min\nat 21,000 \u2000 g at 4\u2000C. The supernatants were spiked with 1\nmg of the internal standard salicylic acid-d6 (C/D/N Isotopes,\nQuebec, Canada) and dried in vacuo. The dry residues were\nsuspended in 10 ml of O-methoxylamine hydrochloride (30 mg\nml\U001000001 in anhydrous pyridine, both from Millipore Sigma) and\nincubated while mixing (1,000 RPM) for 90 min at 30\u2000C.\nSubsequently, samples were derivatized with 90 ml of MSTFA\nwith 1% TMCS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,\nUnited States) for 30 min at 37\u2000C. Gas chromatography-mass\nspectroscopy analysis was performed using a Pegasus 4D timeof-\nflight mass spectrometer (LECO, Saint Joseph MI) equipped\nwith a MPS2 autosampler (Gerstel, Linthicum, MD) and a 7890A\noven (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States).\nThe derivatization products were separated on a 30-m, 0.25 mm\ni.d., 0.25 mm df Rxi-5Sil column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA,\nUnited States) with an IntegraGuard precolumn using ultrapure\nHe at a constant flow of 0.9 ml min\U001000001 as carrier gas. The linear\nthermal gradient started with a 1-min hold at 70\u2000C, followed\nby a ramp to 300\u2000C at 10\u2000C min\U001000001. The final temperature was\nheld for 5 min prior to returning to initial conditions. Mass\nspectra were collected at 17 spectra s\U001000001. Peak identification was\nconducted using the Fiehn primary metabolite library (Kind\net al., 2009) and an identity score cutoff of 700. Additionally,\nauthentic standards for a number of primary metabolites were\nanalyzed under identical conditions and the data used to compare\nthe chromatographic behavior. Peak alignment and spectrum\ncomparisons were carried out using the Statistical Compare\nfeature of ChromaTOF software (LECO).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 3 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nIsolation of RNA From Bacteria Cultured\nin Root Exudates and RNA-Seq\nThe strains were pregrown overnight at 25\u2000C on 21C-glucose\nagar and then subcultured into 96-well microplates containing\nliquid 21C-glucose medium amended with Brachypodium\nexudates. The liquid medium was prepared by dissolving the\nlyophilized root exudate material in an appropriate volume of\n21C-glucose medium to concentrate root exudates 20-fold. The\ngrowth medium was sterilized by passing it through a 0.22-\nmm membrane filter. The control cultures were grown under\nidentical conditions in the absence of exudates. All treatments\nwere inoculated at OD600 of 0.1 and incubated for 20 to\n22 h until cultures entered late-exponential growth phase at\n25\u2000C in an atmosphere of 15% oxygen [created by a ProOx\nP110 oxygen controller (BioSpherix, Parish, NY, United States)\nwith a hypoxia C-chamber]. The cells were stabilized by the\naddition RNAprotect reagent (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD,\nUnited States) and total RNA was purified using a RNeasy Protect\nBacteria Mini Kit (QIAGEN) from three biological replicates of\neach strain cultured under control conditions and in exudates.\nThe quality assessment of the extracted RNA samples was\nperformed with a NanoDrop OneC Spectrophotometer (Thermo\nFisher Scientific) and a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies)\nand revealed A260/A280 and A260/A230 values of > 2.0 and a mean\nRNA integrity numbers (RIN) value of > 9.2.\nThree biological replicates of RNA samples were shipped on\ndry ice to the DOE Joint Genome Institute (Walnut Creek, CA,\nUnited States), where rRNA was depleted and stranded RNASeq\nlibraries were prepared, quantified by qPCR and sequenced\nusing a HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina). The fastq file reads\nwere filtered and processed with BBDuk1 to remove reads that\ncontained 1 or more “N” bases, had an average quality score\nacross the read less than 10 or had a minimum length < 51 bp\nor 33% of the full read length. Reads mapped with BBMap (see\ntext footnote 2) to masked human, cat, dog, and mouse references\nat 93% identity were removed. Another category of removed\nsequences matched RNA spike-in, PhiX, common microbial\ncontaminants, and ribosomal RNAs. The processed reads from\neach library were aligned to the reference genome using BBMap\nwith only unique mappings allowed (BAMs/directory). If a\nread mapped to more than one location it was ignored.\nfeatureCounts (Liao et al., 2014) was used to generate raw\ngene counts, which were normalized to adjust for the length of\neach gene and total number of reads mapped for each library.\nThe normalization formula used: n = [r/(l/1,000)]/(t/1,000,000),\nwhere n = normalized read count for gene (G) for library (L);\nr = raw read count for gene G for library L; l = gene G length; and\nt = total reads mapped for library L. Raw gene counts were used to\nevaluate the level of correlation between biological samples using\nPearson’s correlation.\nBioinformatic Analysis\nCount tables generated by the JGI RNA-Seq pipeline were input\ninto DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) to normalize and determine\n1https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/\ndifferential expression. Statistical significance was established\nthrough DESeq2 by using three biological replicates for control\nand root exudate conditions. Scatterplots were generated from\nthe DESeq2 data table outputs using ggplot2. Genes differentially\nexpressed between control and root exudate samples (log2 foldchanges\n–2 \u2000 to \u2000 2, adjusted p value \u2000 0.05) were used in\ndownstream analysis. The core genome and pangenome for the\nPseudomonas strains used in this study were computed using the\nOthoMCL v.2.0, Species Tree Builder v.2.2.0, and Phylogenetic\nPangenome Accumulation v1.4.0 apps implemented in the U.S.\nDepartment of Energy Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase)\n(Arkin et al., 2018). Additional comparisons were conducted\nwith the PGAweb pangenome analysis pipeline (Chen et al.,\n2018). Differentially expressed genes were assigned to core,\nnon-core, and singleton parts of each strain’s proteome by\nBLASTp with an E value cutoff of e-06, identity of 40%\nand coverage of 60%. Functional annotation of differentially\nexpressed genes was carried out with the Blast2GO (Conesa\nand Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al.,\n2018). Additional manual curation was performed using tools\nimplemented in the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG)\ndatabase (Markowitz et al., 2012), Pseudomonas Genome\nDatabase (Winsor et al., 2009), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and\nGenomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa et al., 2008), and Geneious 10.2.3\n(Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand). Metabolic functions\nencoded by the differentially expressed genes were mapped\nusing iPath 3.0 (Darzi et al., 2018). Phylogenetic analyses\nwere carried out by building multiple sequence alignments\nwith MAFFT v7.222 (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and inferring\nneighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenies with Geneious Tree Builder.\nThe resultant phylogenetic trees were visualized with iTOL\n(Letunic and Bork, 2016). Reproducibility of clades within the\ninferred NJ trees was assessed by bootstrap resampling with\n1,000 replicates.\nCharacterization of Carbon Source\nUtilization With Biolog Phenotype\nMicroarrays\nThe utilization of carbon sources was analyzed using Phenotype\nMicroArrays (Biolog, Hayward, CA, United States) as follows.\nThe bacteria were cultured overnight on Luria-Bertani agar\nat 25\u2000C, after which cells were harvested and suspended in\ninoculating fluid (IF-0). The transmittance of the suspension\nwas adjusted to 42% using a Biolog turbidimeter. The cell\nsuspension was mixed with IF\U001000000 containing Dye Mix A\n(Biolog) to achieve a final transmittance of 85%. One hundred\nmicroliter aliquots of the adjusted cell suspension were\ninoculated into PM01 and PM02A plates, which were then\nincubated in an OmniLog Phenotype MicroArray System\n(Biolog) at 25\u2000C for 48 h. The formation of formazan was\nrecorded at 15 min intervals, and data were analyzed using\nOmniLog Parametric Analysis software v1.20.02 (Biolog).\nRelative growth of the studied strains was normalized to\ngrowth on D-glucose and visualized using Heatmapper\n(Babicki et al., 2016).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 4 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nData Availability\nSequences generated in this project were deposited\nunder NCBI BioProject accession numbers PRJNA439743\nthrough PRJNA439790.\nRESULTS\nMetabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates\nof B. distachyon\nMetabolomics analysis of lyophilized root exudates revealed\nthe presence of numerous plant metabolites, 86 of which were\nidentified by matching their spectra to the LECO/Fiehn\nMetabolomics library (Supplementary Table 3). These\nmetabolites included (i) carbohydrates and their derivatives\n(glucose, fructose, xylose, sucrose, trehalose, maltose, galactose,\nand others); (ii) sugar alcohols (b-mannosylglycerate, myoinositol,\ngalactinol, 2-deoxyerythritol, ribitol, threitol and\ncellobitol); (iii) amino acids and derivatives (glutamine,\ntyrosine, glutamic acid, asparagine, aspartic acid, valine,\nphenylalanine, isoleucine, glycine, serine, proline, leucine,\ntryptophan, cysteine, methionine, citrulline, and others); (iv)\norganic acids (aconitic, allantoic, g-aminobutyric, azelaic, citric,\nfumaric, 2-furoic, D-glyceric, 3-hydroxypropionic, a-ketoadipic,\nmalic, methylmalonic, nicotinic, quinic, succinic, threonic);\nand (v) assorted metabolites including heterocyclic compounds,\nphenolics, and biogenic amines, etc (3-hydroxypyridine,\nmaleimide, noradrenaline, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoate,\n5-methoxytryptamine, uracil, aminomalonic acid, palmitic acid,\nand urea). Results of the analysis also revealed that root exudates\nof B. distachyon contain hydroxyectoine and the quaternary\namine (QA) glycine betaine (Supplementary Figure 1).\nPhylogenetic and Pangenome Analyses\nof Pseudomonas Strains Used in the\nStudy\nWe used a set of phylogenetic markers suggested by Mulet et al.\n(2010) to investigate the relatedness of the eight strains used in\nthis study to distinct lineages recognized within the P. fluorescens\nspecies complex. The multilocus sequence analysis based on\nthe concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S\nrRNA), gyrB, rpoB, and rpoD identified R1-43-08 (along with\nstrains 2-79 and SBW25) as a member of the P. fluorescens\nsubgroup (Figure 1). The rest of the strains clustered closely with\nfour additional subgroups of the P. fluorescens complex, namely\nP. corrugata (strains Q2-87 and Q8r1-96), P. koreensis (Pf0-1),\nP. protegens (Pf-5), and P. chlororaphis (30–84). The genomes of\nthe eight rhizosphere Pseudomonas strains varied in size by 1.43\nmegabase (ranging from 5.65 to 7.07 Mb) and contained between\n5,166 and 6,363 protein-coding genes (Figure 2A). The shared\ngene content was characterized with OrthoMCL, which uses allagainst-\nall BLASTp followed by the Markov Cluster algorithm to\nidentify protein groups shared between the compared genomes,\nas well as groups representing species-specific gene expansion\nfamilies (Li et al., 2003). The pangenome analysis revealed a\ncore comprised of approximately 3,179 orthologs that were\nshared among all strains and represented 50.0% to 61.5%\nof each predicted proteome (Figures 2A,B). The non-core\npangenome contained genes shared by two or more (but not\nall) strains and contained between 1,482 and 2,080 orthologs,\nwhich corresponded to 28.7–36.3% of individual proteomes. The\nrest of the predicted protein-coding genes were strain-specific\nsingletons that comprised 7.5% to 15.1% of the strain’s predicted\nproteomes. In respect to divergence from the core genome, strain\nPf-5 was found to possess the highest proportion of unique genes\n(n = 949) followed by 2-79 (n = 887). The entire pangenome of\nthe Pseudomonas strains encompassed over 12,000 homolog and\nsingleton gene families.\nFurther homolog family-based comparisons identified Q8r1-\n96 and R1-43-08 as the most distantly related strains, with\n3349 shared homologs (Supplementary Table 4A). Q8r1-96 and\nQ2-87, which shared 4,489 homologs, were the most closely\nrelated strains. The partitioning of homolog gene families into\nthe core, non-core, and singleton parts of the pangenome agreed\nwith phylogenetic relationships of the strains deduced from the\nanalysis of a selected subset of COGs (Clusters of Orthologous\nGroups) (Figure 2C and Supplementary Tables 4B,C). The\nCOG-based phylogeny supported the multilocus sequence\nanalysis and revealed that the eight Pseudomonas strains form\nthree distinct clusters, the first of which contained 2-79, R1-30-\n84, and SBW25. The second cluster included Q8r1-96 and Q2-87,\nwhereas the third encompassed strains 30-84, Pf-5, and Pf0-1.\nCorrelating the Composition of Root\nExudates With Metabolic Profiles of\nPseudomonas Strains\nWe used the Phenotype MicroArray PM1 and PM2 plates to\nprofile the eight Pseudomonas strains for the utilization of\n190 different carbon sources. Results of the analysis identified\n90 compounds that supported growth and clustered by their\nintensities of utilization into three distinct groups (Figure 3).\nGroup I was comprised of 30 highly metabolized carbon\nsources, which included several amino acids and intermediates of\nglycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, and citrate cycle. Approximately\nhalf of these compounds were catabolized by all eight strains,\nand included several organic acids (fumaric, citric, gluconic,\nmalic, and pyroglutamic), amino acids (Glu, Asn, Gln, Asp, Pro,\nAla, and g-aminobutyric acid), carbohydrates (glucose, mannose,\nand mannitol), and the purine nucleoside inosine. Group II\nwas composed of 44 chemically diverse carbon sources that\nwere variably utilized by the strains. These compounds were\ncarbohydrates, organic acids, amino acids, phenolics, and polyols,\nand included known compatible solutes and intermediates of\nmetabolism of pentoses, galactose, starch, and sucrose. Group\nIII encompassed the rest of the Phenotype MicroArray test\npanel and contained compounds that were not catabolized\nby the tested strains. Among several notable exceptions were\na-hydroxyglutamic acid- g-lactone, putrescine, and itaconic,\ncitramalic, and succinamic acids, which supported the growth\nof strains 2-79, 30-84, Pf-5, and SBW25.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nFIGURE 1 | Neighbor joining phylogeny showing the relationship of the eight strains used in this study (indicated by red triangles) to different species of the\nP. fluorescens complex. The phylogeny was established based on the concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S rRNA), gyrB (subunit B of DNA\ngyrase), rpoB (b subunit of RNA polymerase), and rpoD (sigma 70 factor subunit of RNA polymerase). Distance matrices were calculated by the Jukes-Cantor\nmethod. Colored circles on tree nodes indicate bootstrap values (1,000 replicates) that vary between 60% (smallest circle) and 100% (largest circles).\nB. distachyon Bd21. Interestingly, many carbon sources from\nthe Phenotype MicroArray panel were also present in the root\nexudates of B. distachyon Bd21, and some of these compounds\n(glucose, mannose, galactose, fructose, g-aminobutyric acid,\naspartic acid, citric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, quinic acid,\nalanine, glutamine, and glutamic acid) were catabolized by all\nstrains used in this study, while others (e.g., xylose, trehalose,\nm-inositol) were actively utilized only by certain organisms\n(Figure 3). The comparison of catabolic profiles across the\neight studied Pseudomonas strains revealed the presence of three\ndistinct clusters. The first cluster contained strains Q8r1-96 and\nQ2-87, which consumed very similar sets of carbon sources,\nas well as strain Pf0-1. The second cluster was composed of\n2-79, R1-43-08, SBW25, and 30-84, whereas the third cluster\nwas represented by a single strain, Pf-5. The overall similarity\nof the catabolic profiles partially agreed with the separation\nof the strains into different subgroups of the P. fluorescens\ncomplex (see above).\nAnalysis of the RNA-seq Results\nIn order to understand the cellular responses of rhizosphere\nPseudomonas to plant exometabolites, we analyzed the\ntranscriptome changes in cultures grown in the presence of\nroot exudates. Under field conditions, rhizobacteria colonize\nplant roots in the form of surface-attached microaerobic biofilms\n(Hojberg et al., 1999). To mimic these conditions, the eight\nPseudomonas strains were grown statically at 72% air saturation\nin 21C-glucose medium amended with root exudates and then\nprocessed to extract total RNA (Supplementary Figure 2).\nA total of 995 million raw sequencing reads were generated from\nthe RNA samples by using the Illumina HiSeq-2500 platform,\naveraging 20.7 million reads per sample. The removal of lowquality\nand rRNA sequences resulted in a total of 793 million\nfiltered reads that were mapped onto the eight Pseudomonas\ngenomes with a mean of 7.48 million mapped fragments per\ngenome. The differentially abundant transcripts were identified\nby setting a p value of 0.05 (adjusted for multiple testing) and\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 6 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

(B) The gradual expansion of\nthe pangenome (blue color) and contraction of the core genome (green color) following the sequential addition of genomes from the dataset. Box plots indicate the\n25th and 75th percentiles and medians (horizontal lines) with whiskers corresponding to the 10th and 90th percentiles. The input order was randomized to avoid any\nbias due to the sequential addition of new genomes. The pangenome size increases steadily without reaching a plateau even after the addition of 11,939\nnon-redundant gene families. At the same time, the core genome converged to 3,179 genes. (C) The pangenome-based phylogenomic analysis of the studied\nstrains. Here, the pangenome was defined with OrthoMCL, and orthologous gene sets were then partitioned into the core, singleton, and non-core (the remaining\northolog sets) categories. These categories were calculated for each node in the Maximum Likelihood species tree, using the set of genomes for which that node\nrepresents the ancestor. The results of the ortholog partitioning are shown in pie charts placed at tree nodes. Numbers indicate bootstrap support values. The\nanalysis was conducted in KBase (Arkin et al., 2018).\nthe log2 fold-change (FC) threshold \u2000\u2000 2.0 (Figure 4 and\nSupplementary Tables 5–12). When compared with the control\nconditions, an average of 204 genes per strain were differentially\nexpressed in the presence of root exudates, with the highest\n(n = 425) and lowest (n = 112) numbers observed, respectively,\nin SBW25 and Q2-87 (Figure 4). Overall, more genes were\ninduced than repressed in response to exudates, but the actual\nnumbers in each category varied substantially depending on the\nidentity of the Pseudomonas strain. In most strains, the bulk of\nthe differentially expressed genes was almost equally distributed\nbetween the core (mean, 48.2%) and non-core (mean, 45.8%)\nparts of the genome, whereas the strain-specific singleton genes\nconstituted on average only 5.9% (Figure 4B). One notable\nexception was observed in Q8r1-96, where all differentially\nexpressed genes belonged to the core (73.8%) and non-core\n(26.2%) parts of the genome. Another notable pattern was\nobserved in R1-43-08, where the majority of genes affected by\nthe presence of root exudate fell into the non-core category\n(56.3%). The highest proportion of differentially expressed\nsingletons (11.3 and 10.4%, respectively) was identified in\nstrains SBW25 and Pf-5.\nWe further explored how the identified differentially\nexpressed genes were distributed across genomes of the eight\nstudied rhizosphere strains. The pairwise BLASTp comparisons\nidentified 2-79 and SBW25 as two strains that shared the highest\nnumber of genes (n = 101) induced or repressed in response\nto root exudates (Table 1). The second pair of strains with\na significant number of similar differentially expressed genes\n(n = 86) was Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, which was followed by Pf0-1\nand 30-84, which shared 56 differentially expressed genes. These\npatterns of shared genes were also observed when the results of\nthe pairwise BLASTp comparisons were converted into a binary\ngene presence/absence matrix, which was then subjected to\ncluster analysis using a UPGMA algorithm based on Sorensen’s\ndissimilarity index or examined by non-metric multidimensional\nscaling (NMDS) (Figure 5).\nThe differentially expressed Pseudomonas genes were\nsubjected to Blast2Go analysis and Gene Ontology (GO)\nannotation (Figure 6). Metabolic process, catalytic activity,\nand membrane were the most common annotation terms\nacross the three primary GO term categories (i.e., biological\nprocess, molecular function, and cellular component). A total\nof 1,694 GO terms was assigned to 805 upregulated genes, with\nthe majority of the GO terms related to molecular function\n(682, 40.3%), followed by biological process (669, 39.5%), and\ncellular component (343, 20.2%). In the 539 downregulated gene\ncategory, 1,101 GO terms were assigned to biological process\n(420, 38.1%), molecular function (417, 37.9%), and cellular\ncomponent (264, 24.0%). Within biological process, metabolic\nprocess, cellular process, localization, response to stimulus, and\nregulation were over-represented. Within molecular function,\nthe largest proportion was assigned to catalytic activity, binding,\nand transporter activity categories. Within cellular component,\nthe majority were assigned to membrane, membrane part, cell,\nand cell part categories. Across the eight strains, 37–42% of\ndifferentially expressed genes had no Gene Ontology IDs and\nencoded various conserved hypothetical proteins.\nFunctional Classification of Shared\nDifferentially Expressed Genes\nThe interrogation of RNA-seq data revealed multiple cellular\npathways that were differentially regulated in bacterial cultures\nincubated with root exudates (Supplementary Figures 3, 4).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 7 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nFIGURE 3 | Biolog Phenotype MicroArray profiling the eight rhizosphere\nPseudomonas strains used in the study. The hierarchical clustering analysis\nwas carried out using the average linkage method with Euclidean distances.\nCarbon sources identified by red arrowheads were also detected in the sterile\nroot exudates of B. distachyon Bd21.\nAlthough none of these differentially regulated pathways were\nshared by all eight strains, the cross-strain comparisons revealed\nseveral types of common and specific transcriptomic responses\nthat were elicited by the presence of plant exometabolites\n(Table 2). The visual representation of core gene expression\npatterns is provided in Supplementary Figure 5, which\nshows heatmaps of expression profiles and p-adj values for\ncore genes shared by the studied strains. The figure is\naccompanied by Supplementary Table 13 that lists predicted\nfunctions of genes constituting the four distinct clusters\nobserved after hierarchical clustering of gene expression\nvalues. The first category of shared differentially expressed\npathways functioned in the uptake and catabolism of selected\ncarbohydrates, quaternary ammonium compounds (QAs), and\nphenolics. All strains except for R1-43-08, responded to root\nexudates by inducing the fructose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate\n(PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTSFru). The\ncomponents of this system are encoded by a conserved\noperon and include the cytoplasmic polyprotein EI/HPr/EIIAFru\n(FruB), the 1-phosphofructokinase FruK, and the fructosespecific\npermease EIIBC (FruA) (Chavarria et al., 2016). The\nPTSFru system functions by acquiring high-energy phosphates\nfrom PEP and sequentially passing them, via the EI/HPr/EIIAFru\ndomains of FruB, to the EIIB component of FruA. The\nphosphates are ultimately transferred by the EIIC transporter\nto fructose yielding fructose 1-phosphate, which is channeled\ninto the central metabolic pathways through the action of the\nphosphofructokinase FruK.\nIn all strains except for Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, the exposure to root\nexudates resulted in the induction of two genes adjacent to the\nfru cluster that encoded a Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS)\ntransporter and an L-arabinonate dehydratase (Table 2). These\ngenes are predicted to participate in the uptake and catabolism\nof L-arabinose, where L-arabinonate dehydratase plays an\nimportant role by converting L-arabinonate to 2-dehydro-3-\ndeoxy-L-arabinonate (Rahman et al., 2017). In SBW25, R1-\n43-08, and Q2-87, we also observed the induction of genes\nencoding components of the AraFGH complex, an ATP-Binding\nCassette (ABC) superfamily transporter involved in the import of\narabinose into the cell (Supplementary Tables 6, 7, 9). Finally, all\nstrains except SBW25 and R1-43-08 responded to the presence\nof exudates by upregulating a conserved gene encoding an\naldose epimerase superfamily protein. Such enzymes equilibrate\nalpha- and beta-anomers of aldoses and ensure that stereospecific\nenzymes involved in the metabolism of free sugars do not act as\nmetabolic bottlenecks (Abayakoon et al., 2018). Although some\naldose epimerases have been linked to specific pathways, the\nPseudomonas gene identified in this study could not be assigned\nto a particular metabolic process based on sequence analysis and\ngenomic location.\nSeveral Pseudomonas strains responded to the presence\nof root exudates by upregulating genes involved in the\nuptake and catabolism of myo-inositol and possibly other\nstereoisomers of inositol (Table 2). The upregulated catabolic\ngenes encode the dehydrogenase IolG, which oxidizes myoinositol\nto its corresponding ketone, as well as IolE, IolD, IolB,\nand IolC that collectively convert the 2-keto-myo-inositol to\nacetyl-CoA and the glycolysis intermediate dihydroxyacetone\nphosphate (Yoshida et al., 2008; Kohler et al., 2011).

The cross-genome comparisons revealed\nthat in all studied strains except for Pf0-1, components\nof the myo-inositol utilization pathway were encoded\nwithin a well-conserved gene cluster which, in addition to\ncatabolic and transport functions, also encodes a dedicated\ntranscriptional repressor.\nAll studied strains of Pseudomonas carry multiple genes\ninvolved in scavenging the quaternary ammonium compounds\ncholine, glycine betaine (GB), carnitine, choline-O-sulfate, and\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 9 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

Many of these genes were\ndifferentially expressed, including those encoding parts of the\nABC transporter CbcXWV, which is predicted to function in\nthe uptake of choline under water-replete conditions (Table 2).\nAmong enzymes induced in the presence of root exudates were\nthe choline dehydrogenase BetA, which converts choline to\nglycine betaine and a network of enzymes (i.e., the Rieske family\noxygenase GbcAB, the dimethyglycine demethylase DgcAB, and\nthe sarcosine oxidase SoxBDAG) that sequentially convert GB\nto glycine. In 2-79 and SBW25, this group of differentially\nregulated genes also included an AraC-family transcriptional\nactivator GbdR, which perceives intercellular levels of GB and\ninduces genes involved in the transport and catabolism of\nglycine betaine and detoxification of the catabolic byproducts\n(Hampel et al., 2014).\nThe last category of activated catabolic pathways included the\ncatechol branch of the b-ketoadipate pathway for the degradation\nof aromatic compounds. In strains 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5,\ngrowth on root exudates resulted in upregulation of catechol-\n1,2-dioxygenase, muconate cycloisomerase, and muconolactone\nisomerase, which collectively cleave the catechol ring and\nconvert it to b-ketoadipate enol-lactone (Harwood and Parales,\n1996). Finally, analysis of the P. synxantha 2-79 transcriptome\nidentified an induction of benABC genes encoding subunits\nof benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase, an oxidoreductase that generates\ncatechol from benzoate.\nIn addition to various catabolic pathways, the exposure to root\nexudates also induced several genes involved in the homeostasis\nof copper (Table 2). Four of these genes form a conserved cluster\nin genomes of the strains and encode the periplasmic coppersensing\ntwo-component system CinRS, the plastocyanin/azurinlike\nprotein CinA, and the NADPH-dependent pre-Q0 reductase\nCinQ. Also, in strains Q2-87, 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, we observed\nupregulation of a conserved operon encoding the multicopper\noxidase CopA, the periplasmic copper-binding protein CopC, the\ninner membrane protein CopD, and outer membrane protein\nCopB. In several Gram-negative bacteria, these Cop proteins are\nthought to have dual functions and participate both in the uptake\nof essential copper as well as in the sequestration of excess copper\nin the periplasm and outer membrane.\nThe analysis of shared downregulated pathways revealed that\nmost of the strains respond to the presence of root exudates by\nrepressing genes involved in the uptake and catabolism of sulfur\ncompounds (Table 2). In strains SBW25, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96,\nQ2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, this response involved the ssuEADCB\noperon responsible for the utilization of alkanesulfonates\nas sulfur sources. The ssu operon is highly conserved in\nfluorescent pseudomonads and encodes the FMNH2-dependent\nmonooxygenase SsuD and the NAD (P)H-dependent FMN\nreductase SsuE, which together catalyze the desulfonation of\nalkanesulfonates. Also, the ssu locus contains genes for the\nmolybdopterin-binding protein SsuF and the alkanesulfonatespecific\nABC-type transporter consisting of the sulfonate\nsubstrate-binding protein SsuA, sulfonate permease protein\nSsuC, and sulfonate transport ATP-binding protein SsuB. Finally,\nin R1-43-08, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, growth on root exudates\ncoincided with repression of the tauABCD operon, which\nallows these strains to utilize taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonate)\nas a sulfur source. The repressed tau genes encoded the\n2-oxoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenase TauD and\nsubstrate-binding, ATP-binding, and permease components of\nthe taurine-specific ABC transporter TauABC.\nOther Differentially Expressed Pathways\nIn addition to their effect on several shared cellular pathways,\ngrowth on root exudates resulted in the induction or repression of\nnumerous strain-specific genes. In closely related P. synxantha 2-\n79 and P. fluorescens SBW25, we observed differential expression\nof genes involved in energy metabolism, transport of amino\nacids, and surface attachment (Supplementary Tables 5, 6).\nOther notable differentially expressed pathways included 2–\n79 gene clusters that encode enzymes for the catabolism of\ntrehalose, a prophage, and toxin/antitoxin system, as well as the\nSBW25 operon predicted to control the synthesis of the capsular\nexopolysaccharide colonic acid. The response of Pseudomonas sp.\nR1-43-08 to root exudates also involved differential expression\nof different energy metabolism pathways. In addition, we\nobserved the upregulation of genes involved in the uptake and\ncatabolism of xylose (also upregulated in 2–79) and repression\nof enzymes for the biosynthesis of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid\nand assimilation of inorganic sulfur and L-cysteine biosynthesis\n(Supplementary Table 7).\nThe analysis of the Q8r1-96 transcriptome revealed\nperturbation of different metabolic pathways including genes\nencoding components of cytochrome C oxidase, transport\nand catabolism of sorbitol/mannitol, metabolism of butanoic\nacid, and biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides alginate and\npoly-b-1-6-N-acetylglucosamine (Supplementary Table 8). In\nP. fluorescens Q2-87, we identified differential expression of\ngenes involved in metabolism of galactose, tryptophan, tyrosine,\nglycine, serine, and threonine (Supplementary Table 9),\nwhile in P. chlororaphis 30-84, growth on exudates activated\nthe biosynthesis of molybdopterin cofactor, catabolism of\ngalactonate and acetoin, and uptake and catabolism of putrescine\n(Supplementary Table 10). The response of P. protegens Pf-5 to\nroot exudates involved upregulation of acetoin dehydrogenase,\nwhich converts acetoin to acetaldehyde and acetyl-CoA, as\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 10 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

The terms were derived from 93 different functional groups (GO subcategories level 4). The GO terms were assigned with Blast2GO (Conesa\nand Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al., 2018). On a WEGO histogram, the percentage of 100 is defined as the total number of genes assigned a GO\nterm. However, the subcategories do not add up to 100% because many genes fall into more than one functional class and are therefore annotated by multiple GO\nterms.\nwell as pathways for the utilization of glycolate and putrescine\n(Supplementary Table 11). Also induced were genes for\nthe production of pyrrolnitrin and PhlG hydrolase, which\nmodulate the metabolic loads attributed to the synthesis of\n2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol. The differentially expressed genes of\nP. fluorescens Pf0-1 included, among others, operons encoding\ncytochrome C oxidase and enzymes for catabolism of malonic\nacid (Supplementary Table 12). Yet another interesting\nfinding involved the induction of assorted genes acting in the\nhomeostasis of iron and defense against reactive oxygen species\n(ROS). We observed activation of iron dicitrate transporters\n(SBW25 and 30-84), genes for the biosynthesis of siderophores\nornicorrugatin (SBW25) and pyochelin (Pf-5), heme-degrading\nenzymes (2–79, 30–84), TonB siderophore receptors, and\ncomponents of the energy-transducing inner membrane\ncomplex TonB-ExbB-ExbD (2–79 and Pf-5). The differentially\nexpressed ROS defense pathways were represented by different\ncatalases in strains 2–79, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and\nPf-5 and organic hydroperoxide resistance proteins in strains\nSBW25 and R1-43-08.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nsoil microorganisms. Our results were in agreement with a\nrecent report of 27 different sugars, amino acids, and organic\nacids in Brachypodium exudates (Kawasaki et al., 2016). We\nconfirmed the presence of exometabolites identified in that\nstudy, along with dozens of additional analytes that were\nidentified by matching their mass-spectra and retention indices\nto the LECO/Fiehn Metabolomics library (Supplementary\nTable 3). The complementation of the metabolomic analysis\nwith profiling of the bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays\nrevealed that a substantial proportion of the characterized\nexudate constituents were catabolized by a collection of eight\nPseudomonas strains from across the P. fluorescens group that is\nknown to form associations with plant roots. The amendment\nof Pseudomonas cultures with root exudates caused changes in\nthe expression of multiple genes encoding catabolic and anabolic\nenzymes, predicted transporters, transcriptional regulators, stress\nresponse, and conserved hypothetical proteins. In most strains,\nthese differentially expressed genes were almost equally split\nbetween the core and variable genome regions, mirroring\nthe substantial strain-to-strain variation in the genome size\nand gene content within the P. fluorescens species complex\n(Loper et al., 2012).\nThe analysis of transcriptome responses to root exudates\nrevealed several types of cellular pathways present in the strains\nused in this study. The first category of such pathways was\ninvolved in the catabolism of carbohydrates such as fructose,\narabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, trehalose, and galactose. Among\nthese catabolic traits, the ability to utilize fructose as a carbon\nsource is highly conserved among fluorescent pseudomonads.\nIn contrast, growth on arabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, and\ntrehalose is variably present and was traditionally used to\ndifferentiate species and biovars within the P. fluorescens\ngroup (Barrett et al., 1986). We speculate that such variably\ndistributed pathways contribute to the differential affinity of\npseudomonads toward host plants and/or to determine which\nstrains flourish in response to growing roots and changing\nenvironments. Several independent studies have confirmed\nthe importance of carbohydrate catabolism pathways for the\nbiology of rhizosphere pseudomonads. For example, in vivo\nexpression technology (IVET) profiling of P. fluorescens SBW25\nidentified xylose isomerase among genome regions essential\nfor the colonization of sugar beet seedlings (Liu et al., 2015),\nwhereas a genome-wide Tn-Seq screen of Pseudomonas simiae\nidentified genes for the catabolism of myo-inositol among traits\nessential for the colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana roots\n(Cole et al., 2017).\nThe response of rhizosphere Pseudomonas to Brachypodium\nroot exudates also involved pathways for the uptake and\nmetabolism of amino acids. We observed differential\nexpression of genes encoding the hydrophobic (HAAT) and\npolar (PAAT) amino acid uptake transporters in strains\n2-79, SBW25, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5. Other related genes\nencoded enzymes for the catabolism of valine and glutamic\nacid (2-79); metabolism of tryptophan, glycine, serine, and\nthreonine (Q2-87); and biosynthesis of methionine (Q8r1-\n96). It is plausible that the abundance of amino acids in\nroot exudates is also linked to the repression of pathways\ninvolved in the catabolism of sulfonates and taurine that\nwas observed in several strains (Table 2). Although the\npreferred source of sulfur for P. fluorescens is unknown, in the\nclosely related P. aeruginosa, the sulfur starvation response\nis triggered by the growth on any sulfur compound other\nthan sulfate, thiocyanate, and cysteine (Hummerjohann et al.,\n1998). This fact, together with the presence of cysteine and\ncystine in the root exudates, suggest that root exudates of\nBrachypodium may serve as an important source of sulfur for\nrhizosphere Pseudomonas. These findings also agree well with\nthe reported scarcity of inorganic sulfate in the soil, and the\npresence of sulfur mostly in the form of organic compounds,\nincluding amino acids, proteins, sulfate esters, and sulfonates\n(Autry and Fitzgerald, 1990).\nAnother interesting result of this study was the concerted\nactivation of copper and iron homeostasis pathways observed\nin all of the Pseudomonas strains used in this work. In bacteria,\nan excess of copper is toxic and triggers oxidative stress due to\nthe formation of free radicals, as well as disruption of protein\nmetalation and stability of iron-sulfur clusters (Bondarczuk\nand Piotrowska-Seget, 2013). On the other hand, copper is an\nessential trace element used as a cofactor in different enzymes.\nSimilarly, although elevated levels of iron cause redox stress, this\nelement is also found in active energy metabolism enzymes and is\ncrucial for bacterial growth (Andrews et al., 2003). The analysis\nof metal homeostasis genes identified in this study suggests\nthat their induction was likely triggered by the deficiency of\ncopper and iron in bacterial cultures grown in the presence of\nroot exudates. We attribute this effect to the ability of some\ncomponents of root exudates to chelate soil metals.\nDespite the abundance of iron in the soil, its bioavailability\nis limited due to the low solubility of Fe (III) oxyhydrates\nat neutral pH. The non-graminaceous plants circumvent this\nproblem by acidifying the rhizosphere and secreting flavins,\nphenolics, and organic acids that chelate iron. The reduction\nof these ferric chelates releases soluble ferrous iron taken up\nby root cells (Kobayashi and Nishizawa, 2012). Graminaceous\nplants, like Brachypodium, acquire iron by secreting into the\nsoil non-protein amino acids of the mugineic acid (MA) group,\nwhich act as Fe (III)-chelating phytosiderophores. In addition to\niron, low-molecular-weight organic acids and phytosiderophores\nbind other divalent and trivalent metals (including copper) and\ncontribute to heavy-metal tolerance in plants (Chen et al., 2017).\nIt is plausible that the presence of these plant exometabolites\nis responsible for the deficit of iron and copper observed in\nPseudomonas cultures grown in the presence of root exudates.\nThese results further underscore the importance of diverse and\nredundant metal homeostasis pathways found in genomes of the\nP. fluorescens group for the ability of these organisms to colonize\nand persist in the plant rhizosphere.\nRecently, Klonowska et al. (2018) examined transcriptomic\nresponses of symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria to root\nexudates of the legume plant Mimosa pundica, which has\nan unusual ability to support both alpha- (Rhizobium) and\nbeta-rhizobia (Cupriavidus and Burkholderia). Using RNA-seq,\nthe authors characterized genes involved in the perception of\nroot exudates in the nodulating bacteria Burkholderia phymatum\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 14 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nSTM815, Cupriavidus taiwanensis LMG19424, and Rhizobium\nmesoamericanum STM3625. Interestingly, the analysis of\ndifferentially expressed genes revealed induction of pathways\ninvolved in the catabolism of fructose, xylose, myo-inositol,\nand protocatechuate/catechol. Also upregulated were some\ncopper homeostasis, siderophore biosynthesis, and oxidative\nstress genes. Finally, the analytical profiling of M. pundica\nexudates revealed an overlap with Brachypodium in the types of\ncarbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids present. These\nfindings suggest that differentially expressed genes shared by\nmultiple strains of the group P. fluorescens are not unique to\nthe Brachypodium-Pseudomonas system but represent a set\nof conserved cellular pathways involved in the perception of\nplant exometabolites by different clades of rhizosphere-dwelling\nProteobacteria.\nMost strains included in this study were originally selected\nbased on the ability to colonize the rhizosphere and produce\nsecondary metabolites that alleviate the plant stress response\nand/or inhibit soilborne pathogens. It has been suggested\nthat plant metabolites released into the rhizosphere affect\nthe biocontrol activity of plant-beneficial pseudomonads (de\nWerra et al., 2011). We provide further support to this\nhypothesis by demonstrating that in some strains, root exudates\nmodulate the expression of genes for the catabolism of\nthe plant growth-promoting metabolites acetoin and 2,3-\nbutanediol. The exposure to exudates also affected the expression\nof genes for the synthesis of well-characterized antifungal\ncompounds pyrrolnitrin, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, and 2,4-\ndiacetylphloroglucinol. The modulatory effects were strainspecific,\nsuggesting significant differences in the regulatory\nnetworks involved in the perception of plant signals and\nregulation of the production of antibiotics and growthpromoting\nmetabolites.\nThe final significant finding of this study was the induction\nof catabolism of quaternary amines (QAs) observed in multiple\nstrains of the P. fluorescens group during growth on root\nexudates. This observation was supported by the detection of\nglycine betaine in the root secretions of B. distachyon. The\npresence of QAs in plant tissues and the capacity of these\nmetabolites to provide stress protection and nutrients to plant\npathogens and symbionts were reported before (Boncompagni\net al., 1999; Chen et al., 2013; Kabbadj et al., 2017), but our\nstudy is among the first to highlight the potential importance of\nthese metabolites for rhizosphere interactions. Pseudomonads do\nnot synthesize QAs de novo but have evolved many pathways to\nscavenge them from eukaryotic hosts, where these metabolites\nare abundant due to the prominence of phosphatidylcholine\nin cellular membranes. Strains of P. fluorescens carry genes\nfor the conversion of choline, carnitine, and glycine betaine to\nglycine, as well as quaternary amine transporters of the BCCT\nand ABC families that are also conserved in the opportunistic\nhuman pathogen P. aeruginosa and the plant pathogen P. syringae\n(Galvao et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2013; Wargo, 2013b).\nIn P. aeruginosa, choline catabolism genes are essential for\nthe ability of this pathogen to persist during lung infection\n(Wargo, 2013a). Similarly, a P. syringae mutant deficient in\nBetT, OpuC, and CbcXWV quaternary amine transporters had\nreduced fitness during colonization of bean and soybean leaves\nunder greenhouse and field conditions (Chen et al., 2013).\nDepending on water availability, P. aeruginosa and P. syringae\ncatabolize exogenously supplied QAs as carbon and nitrogen\nsources or accumulate them as osmoprotectants (Chen et al.,\n2013; Wargo, 2013b). Our ongoing work in P. synxantha 2–\n79 unraveled similar physiological responses and demonstrated\nthat QA transporters function differentially and redundantly\nin the uptake of quaternary amines as nutrients (Pablo and\nMavrodi, unpublished). In contrast, under water stress, the QAs\ncholine, betaine, and carnitine are accumulated preferentially for\nosmoprotection. Under drought stress, a 2–79 mutant devoid\nof all known QA transporters was less competitive in the\ncolonization of the Brachypodium rhizosphere than its wild-type\nparental strain. Interestingly, our metabolomic profiling of root\nexudates also revealed proline, glutamine, and hydroxyectoine.\nThese metabolites act as compatible solutes in different groups\nof microorganisms (Yancey et al., 1982; Empadinhas and da\nCosta, 2008), suggesting an important role of root exudates\nin the ability of Pseudomonas to persist in the rhizosphere of\ndrought-stressed plants.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe original contributions presented in the study are publicly\navailable.

Plant roots secrete carbon-rich rhizodeposits containing primary and\nsecondary low molecular weight metabolites, lysates, and mucilages. These exudates\nprovide nutrients for soil microorganisms and modulate their affinity to host plants, but\nmolecular details of this process are largely unresolved. We addressed this gap by\nfocusing on the molecular dialog between eight well-characterized beneficial strains\nof the Pseudomonas fluorescens group and Brachypodium distachyon, a model for\neconomically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops of the grass family. We\ncollected and analyzed root exudates of B. distachyon and demonstrated the presence\nof multiple carbohydrates, amino acids, organic acids, and phenolic compounds. The\nsubsequent screening of bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays revealed that many\nof these metabolites provide carbon and energy for the Pseudomonas strains. RNAseq\nprofiling of bacterial cultures amended with root exudates revealed changes in the\nexpression of genes encoding numerous catabolic and anabolic enzymes, transporters,\ntranscriptional regulators, stress response, and conserved hypothetical proteins. Almost\nhalf of the differentially expressed genes mapped to the variable part of the strains’\npangenome, reflecting the importance of the variable gene content in the adaptation of\nP. fluorescens to the rhizosphere lifestyle. Our results collectively reveal the diversity\nof cellular pathways and physiological responses underlying the establishment of\nmutualistic interactions between these beneficial rhizobacteria and their plant hosts.\nKeywords: Pseudomonas, Brachypodium, rhizosphere, root exudates, transcriptome\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 1 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nINTRODUCTION\nPlants are meta-organisms or holobionts that rely in part on\ntheir microbiome for specific functions and traits. The ability\nof the plant microbiome to influence plant development, vigor,\nhealth, and fitness in response to abiotic stressors associated\nwith global climate change is documented by numerous studies\n(Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009). There is mounting evidence\nthat plants actively recruit beneficial microbiomes, but many\naspects of this process are still very much a black box (Reinhold-\nHurek et al., 2015). The foundation for the differential affinity\nof rhizobacteria toward host plants is built upon complex\nchemical cross talk between microorganisms and plant roots.\nUp to 40% of photosynthetically fixed carbon is released by\nplant roots in the form of exudates and secretions, lysates, and\nmucilages (Curl and Truelove, 1986; Lynch, 1990; Whipps, 1990;\nBadri and Vivanco, 2009). The release of these compounds is\nactively controlled in response to environmental stimuli, and the\ncomposition of root exudates varies greatly according to plant\nspecies and physiological condition (Lynch, 1990; Nguyen, 2003;\nPhillips et al., 2004; De-la-Pena et al., 2008). The presence and\ncomposition of exudates strongly impact soil microorganisms,\nwhich is consistent with the idea that plants actively select and\nshape their root microbiota (Zolla et al., 2013).\nPrimary root exudates include simple and complex sugars,\namino acids, polypeptides and proteins, organic, aliphatic and\nfatty acids, sterols, and phenolics (Nguyen, 2003; Badri and\nVivanco, 2009; Badri et al., 2009). These compounds serve as\ncarbon and energy sources for rhizobacteria, and the presence\nof the intact corresponding catabolic pathways is essential\nfor competitive colonization of roots and disease suppression\n(Lugtenberg et al., 2001; Kamilova et al., 2005; Lugtenberg and\nKamilova, 2009). Root exudates also contain numerous signal\nmolecules and secondary metabolites, the significance of which\nis only now emerging (Walker et al., 2003; Bais et al., 2005,\n2006). A handful of analyses of plant-induced gene expression\nby transcriptional profiling in vitro (Mark et al., 2005) or in\nthe rhizosphere (Silby and Levy, 2004; Ramos-Gonzalez et al.,\n2005; Matilla et al., 2007; Barret et al., 2009) have identified\nmultiple genes that are differentially regulated by exposure to\nroots or root exudates. Bacterial pathways expressed during\nrhizosphere colonization control utilization of plant-derived\nmetabolites (Simons et al., 1996, 1997; Camacho-Carvajal, 2001;\nLugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), motility and chemotaxis (de\nWeert et al., 2002; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), phase\nvariation (Dekkers et al., 1998; Sanchez-Contreras et al., 2002;\nvan den Broek et al., 2005), outer membrane integrity (de Weert\net al., 2006; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), and the ability\nto sequester limiting resources (Raaijmakers et al., 1995) and\nresist environmental stresses (Sarniguet et al., 1995; Miller and\nWood, 1996; van Veen et al., 1997; Schnider-Keel et al., 2001). In\nits spatial and temporal properties, root colonization resembles\nbiofilm formation, and biofilm-related pathways also have been\nimplicated in adhesion to seeds and roots and rhizosphere\ncolonization (Espinosa-Urgel et al., 2000; Hinsa et al., 2003;\nYousef-Coronado et al., 2008; Fuqua, 2010; Martinez-Gil et al.,\n2010; Nielsen et al., 2011; Zboralski and Filion, 2020). Finally,\nroot exudates strongly affect the expression of diverse plant\ngrowth promotion and biocontrol genes (Vacheron et al., 2013).\nOver the past decade, the genomes of numerous rhizosphere\nstrains have been sequenced and analyzed, but functional\ngenomics studies of rhizosphere competence lag behind the\navailability of sequence data.\nThis study explored the molecular dialog between the\nmodel host plant Brachypodium distachyon and several wellcharacterized\nrhizosphere strains of the Pseudomonas fluorescens\ngroup. Brachypodium is a small annual grass originating in semiarid\nregions of the Middle East that has emerged as a prime model\nfor economically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops\nof the grass family (Bevan et al., 2010; Schwartz et al., 2010;\nBrkljacic et al., 2011; Hong et al., 2011; Tyler et al., 2014). The\nbiology, extensive collection of resources, and research tools\nmake B. distachyon an attractive model to investigate interactions\nbetween plants and root-associated microbes. Pseudomonads\nare ubiquitous Gram-negative g-proteobacteria that colonize\neukaryotic hosts and include both commensals and economically\nimportant pathogens of plants and animals (Moore et al.,\n2006; Schroth et al., 2006; Yahr and Parsek, 2006). The genus\nPseudomonas currently comprises > 100 named species that have\nbeen separated based on multilocus sequence analysis into 14\nspecies groups (Garrido-Sanz et al., 2016; Hesse et al., 2018).\nThe P. fluorescens group is the most diverse regarding both\nthe genetic distances within it, the number of species and the\nlarge pangenome that makes up > 50% of the pangenome\nof the genus as a whole (Loper et al., 2012). The group also\nencompasses an unusually high proportion of strains that inhabit\nthe plant rhizosphere and possess plant growth promoting and\nbiocontrol properties. Naylor et al. (2017) profiled bacterial\ncommunities associated with root tissues and rhizosphere of\n18 different plant species of the Poaceae family. That study\nidentified Pseudomonas among taxa constituting the core grass\nroot microbiome and demonstrated that these bacteria were\nenriched in C3 plants, including wheat, rye, barley, oat, and\nBrachypodium. We confirmed the capacity of B. distachyon\nBd21 to serve as a host for rhizobacteria of the P. fluorescens\ngroup in preliminary greenhouse assays with biocontrol strains\nP. synxantha 2-79, P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96, and P. protegens\nPf-5. Results of these experiments revealed that all strains\nsuccessfully established and colonized the roots of Brachypodium\n(Supplementary Table 1).\nIn this study, we focused on eight well-studied strains\nof the P. fluorescens complex that are supported by years\nof studies, numerous refereed publications, and high-quality\ngenome sequences. By profiling transcriptomes of these strains\nduring growth in root exudates of B. distachyon, we revealed the\ndiversity of cellular pathways and physiological responses that\nunderlie the establishment of mutualistic interactions between\nbeneficial rhizobacteria and the host plant. Our results also\nconfirmed that root exudates contain carbohydrates, amino acids,\norganic acids, and phenolics that serve as carbon and energy\nsources for rhizobacteria. The root exudates also contained\nosmoprotectants that may help microorganisms to persist in the\nrhizosphere of drought-stressed plants.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nthe variable genome in adaptation of individual strains of\nPseudomonas to the rhizosphere lifestyle.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacterial Strains Used in the Study\nThe eight Pseudomonas strains used for this study are\nP. synxantha 2-79 (Thomashow and Weller, 1988), P. fluorescens\nSBW25 (Silby et al., 2009), Pseudomonas sp. R1-43-08 (Parejko\net al., 2012), P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96 (Raaijmakers and Weller,\n1998), P. fluorescens Q2-87 (Bangera and Thomashow, 1996),\nP. chlororaphis 30-84 (Thomashow et al., 1990), P. fluorescens\nPf0-1 (Silby et al., 2009), and P. protegens Pf-5 (Howell and\nStipanovic, 1980). The selected organisms have been studied\nextensively for their role in biological control and plant\ngrowth promotion (Supplementary Table 2). The strains were\nmaintained in the laboratory as frozen stocks (\U0010000080\u2000C) and\nroutinely cultured in King’s medium B (King et al., 1954) or\n21C medium, which contained (per 1 L): 1.0 g of NH4Cl, 3.5 g\nof Na2HPO4\u20002H2O, 2.8 g of KH2PO4, 3.0 g of glucose, and\n20 ml of a microelement solution (Smibert and Kreig, 1994;\nHalverson and Firestone, 2000).\nPropagation of Plants and Collection of\nRoot Exudates\nB. distachyon Bd21 was established from seed material obtained\nfrom the USDA-ARS Plant Germplasm Introduction and Testing\nResearch Unit (Pullman, WA, United States). Brachypodium\nseeds were imbibed for 3 days at 4\u2000C and sown in 7 \u2000 7 cm\npots filled with Sunshine Potting Mix #4 (Sun Gro Horticulture,\nAgawam, MA, United States). Plants were grown in an IR-\n89X (Percival Scientific, Perry, IA, United States) controlled\nenvironment chamber retrofitted with 6500K and 3000K T5 54W\ngrow lights (Spectralux) under a 20-h light, 24\u2000C/4-h dark, 18\u2000C\ncycle. Plants were watered and fertilized with Jack’s professional\nwater-soluble fertilizer (20:20:20) (JR Peters, Allentown, PA,\nUnited States). After 12 weeks and plant senescence, seeds\nwere collected, processed, and stored under desiccant and dark\nconditions at room temperature.\nTo collect root exudates, seeds of B. distachyon Bd21 were\nsurface-sterilized, pregerminated, and placed in sterile 1 L widemouth\nglass jars containing 113 g of 6-mm glass beads and\n25 ml distilled water. Jars were covered with vented caps\nand plants were grown hydroponically in an environmental\ncontrolled growth chamber under conditions described above.\nAfter 6 days, root exudates were extracted from individual\njars and their sterility was confirmed by spotting on nutrient\nagar. Multiple batches of root exudates were collected, filtered\n(0.22 mm), aliquoted in Falcon tubes (10 ml), lyophilized, and\nstored at –80\u2000C.\nMetabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates\nExudates were analyzed for primary metabolites at the Murdock\nMetabolomics Laboratory at Washington State University\n(Pullman, WA, United States). Freeze-dried residues were\nsuspended in 500 ml 50% aqueous acetonitrile and clarified by\ncentrifugation for 20 min at 21,000 \u2000 g and 4\u2000C. The liquid\nchromatography mass spectrometry analysis was conducted\nwith a Synapt G2-S quadrupole-ion mobility spectrometrytime\nof flight mass spectrometer system equipped with an\nacquity ultra-performance liquid chromatograph (UPLC) and\nan acquity photodiode array detector (all from Waters, Milford,\nMA, United States). The exudate metabolites were separated\non a SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC HPLC column (2.1 \u2000 100 mm,\n3 mm) (Milllipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, United States) using\nacetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid as solvent B and water\nwith 0.1% formic acid as solvent A at a flow rate of 400 ml\nmin\U001000001 and the following linear gradient extending over 14 min:\n0 min, 80% B; 4 min, 80% B, 6 min: 10% B; 7.5 min, 10%\nB; 10 min, 80% B; and 14 min, 80% B. Mass spectra were\ncollected in positive ion mode over a range of m/z 50–1,200\nwith a scan time of 0.2 s. The Q-TOF-MS source was at\n3.0 kV and 120\u2000C; the sampling cone at 40 V, desolvation\ntemperature was 250\u2000C; cone gas and desolvation gas flow were\nat 0 and 850 L h\U001000001, respectively. Leucine enkephalin was used\nfor post-acquisition mass correction. Target compounds were\nvisualized using selected ion chromatograms at 0.05 Da window\nwidth. The compound identification was based on comparison\nof chromatographic behavior and accurate masses to those of\nauthentic standards.\nFor gas chromatography, derivatization was carried out using\na modification of the procedure of Lee and Fiehn (2008).\nThe freeze-dried residues were suspended in 950 ml aqueous\nmethanol (84%, v/v) and clarified by centrifugation for 15 min\nat 21,000 \u2000 g at 4\u2000C. The supernatants were spiked with 1\nmg of the internal standard salicylic acid-d6 (C/D/N Isotopes,\nQuebec, Canada) and dried in vacuo. The dry residues were\nsuspended in 10 ml of O-methoxylamine hydrochloride (30 mg\nml\U001000001 in anhydrous pyridine, both from Millipore Sigma) and\nincubated while mixing (1,000 RPM) for 90 min at 30\u2000C.\nSubsequently, samples were derivatized with 90 ml of MSTFA\nwith 1% TMCS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,\nUnited States) for 30 min at 37\u2000C. Gas chromatography-mass\nspectroscopy analysis was performed using a Pegasus 4D timeof-\nflight mass spectrometer (LECO, Saint Joseph MI) equipped\nwith a MPS2 autosampler (Gerstel, Linthicum, MD) and a 7890A\noven (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States).\nThe derivatization products were separated on a 30-m, 0.25 mm\ni.d., 0.25 mm df Rxi-5Sil column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA,\nUnited States) with an IntegraGuard precolumn using ultrapure\nHe at a constant flow of 0.9 ml min\U001000001 as carrier gas. The linear\nthermal gradient started with a 1-min hold at 70\u2000C, followed\nby a ramp to 300\u2000C at 10\u2000C min\U001000001. The final temperature was\nheld for 5 min prior to returning to initial conditions. Mass\nspectra were collected at 17 spectra s\U001000001. Peak identification was\nconducted using the Fiehn primary metabolite library (Kind\net al., 2009) and an identity score cutoff of 700. Additionally,\nauthentic standards for a number of primary metabolites were\nanalyzed under identical conditions and the data used to compare\nthe chromatographic behavior. Peak alignment and spectrum\ncomparisons were carried out using the Statistical Compare\nfeature of ChromaTOF software (LECO).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 3 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nIsolation of RNA From Bacteria Cultured\nin Root Exudates and RNA-Seq\nThe strains were pregrown overnight at 25\u2000C on 21C-glucose\nagar and then subcultured into 96-well microplates containing\nliquid 21C-glucose medium amended with Brachypodium\nexudates. The liquid medium was prepared by dissolving the\nlyophilized root exudate material in an appropriate volume of\n21C-glucose medium to concentrate root exudates 20-fold. The\ngrowth medium was sterilized by passing it through a 0.22-\nmm membrane filter. The control cultures were grown under\nidentical conditions in the absence of exudates. All treatments\nwere inoculated at OD600 of 0.1 and incubated for 20 to\n22 h until cultures entered late-exponential growth phase at\n25\u2000C in an atmosphere of 15% oxygen [created by a ProOx\nP110 oxygen controller (BioSpherix, Parish, NY, United States)\nwith a hypoxia C-chamber]. The cells were stabilized by the\naddition RNAprotect reagent (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD,\nUnited States) and total RNA was purified using a RNeasy Protect\nBacteria Mini Kit (QIAGEN) from three biological replicates of\neach strain cultured under control conditions and in exudates.\nThe quality assessment of the extracted RNA samples was\nperformed with a NanoDrop OneC Spectrophotometer (Thermo\nFisher Scientific) and a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies)\nand revealed A260/A280 and A260/A230 values of > 2.0 and a mean\nRNA integrity numbers (RIN) value of > 9.2.\nThree biological replicates of RNA samples were shipped on\ndry ice to the DOE Joint Genome Institute (Walnut Creek, CA,\nUnited States), where rRNA was depleted and stranded RNASeq\nlibraries were prepared, quantified by qPCR and sequenced\nusing a HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina). The fastq file reads\nwere filtered and processed with BBDuk1 to remove reads that\ncontained 1 or more “N” bases, had an average quality score\nacross the read less than 10 or had a minimum length < 51 bp\nor 33% of the full read length. Reads mapped with BBMap (see\ntext footnote 2) to masked human, cat, dog, and mouse references\nat 93% identity were removed. Another category of removed\nsequences matched RNA spike-in, PhiX, common microbial\ncontaminants, and ribosomal RNAs. The processed reads from\neach library were aligned to the reference genome using BBMap\nwith only unique mappings allowed (BAMs/directory). If a\nread mapped to more than one location it was ignored.\nfeatureCounts (Liao et al., 2014) was used to generate raw\ngene counts, which were normalized to adjust for the length of\neach gene and total number of reads mapped for each library.\nThe normalization formula used: n = [r/(l/1,000)]/(t/1,000,000),\nwhere n = normalized read count for gene (G) for library (L);\nr = raw read count for gene G for library L; l = gene G length; and\nt = total reads mapped for library L. Raw gene counts were used to\nevaluate the level of correlation between biological samples using\nPearson’s correlation.\nBioinformatic Analysis\nCount tables generated by the JGI RNA-Seq pipeline were input\ninto DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) to normalize and determine\n1https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/\ndifferential expression. Statistical significance was established\nthrough DESeq2 by using three biological replicates for control\nand root exudate conditions. Scatterplots were generated from\nthe DESeq2 data table outputs using ggplot2. Genes differentially\nexpressed between control and root exudate samples (log2 foldchanges\n–2 \u2000 to \u2000 2, adjusted p value \u2000 0.05) were used in\ndownstream analysis. The core genome and pangenome for the\nPseudomonas strains used in this study were computed using the\nOthoMCL v.2.0, Species Tree Builder v.2.2.0, and Phylogenetic\nPangenome Accumulation v1.4.0 apps implemented in the U.S.\nDepartment of Energy Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase)\n(Arkin et al., 2018). Additional comparisons were conducted\nwith the PGAweb pangenome analysis pipeline (Chen et al.,\n2018). Differentially expressed genes were assigned to core,\nnon-core, and singleton parts of each strain’s proteome by\nBLASTp with an E value cutoff of e-06, identity of 40%\nand coverage of 60%. Functional annotation of differentially\nexpressed genes was carried out with the Blast2GO (Conesa\nand Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al.,\n2018). Additional manual curation was performed using tools\nimplemented in the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG)\ndatabase (Markowitz et al., 2012), Pseudomonas Genome\nDatabase (Winsor et al., 2009), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and\nGenomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa et al., 2008), and Geneious 10.2.3\n(Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand). Metabolic functions\nencoded by the differentially expressed genes were mapped\nusing iPath 3.0 (Darzi et al., 2018). Phylogenetic analyses\nwere carried out by building multiple sequence alignments\nwith MAFFT v7.222 (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and inferring\nneighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenies with Geneious Tree Builder.\nThe resultant phylogenetic trees were visualized with iTOL\n(Letunic and Bork, 2016). Reproducibility of clades within the\ninferred NJ trees was assessed by bootstrap resampling with\n1,000 replicates.\nCharacterization of Carbon Source\nUtilization With Biolog Phenotype\nMicroarrays\nThe utilization of carbon sources was analyzed using Phenotype\nMicroArrays (Biolog, Hayward, CA, United States) as follows.\nThe bacteria were cultured overnight on Luria-Bertani agar\nat 25\u2000C, after which cells were harvested and suspended in\ninoculating fluid (IF-0). The transmittance of the suspension\nwas adjusted to 42% using a Biolog turbidimeter. The cell\nsuspension was mixed with IF\U001000000 containing Dye Mix A\n(Biolog) to achieve a final transmittance of 85%. One hundred\nmicroliter aliquots of the adjusted cell suspension were\ninoculated into PM01 and PM02A plates, which were then\nincubated in an OmniLog Phenotype MicroArray System\n(Biolog) at 25\u2000C for 48 h. The formation of formazan was\nrecorded at 15 min intervals, and data were analyzed using\nOmniLog Parametric Analysis software v1.20.02 (Biolog).\nRelative growth of the studied strains was normalized to\ngrowth on D-glucose and visualized using Heatmapper\n(Babicki et al., 2016).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 4 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nData Availability\nSequences generated in this project were deposited\nunder NCBI BioProject accession numbers PRJNA439743\nthrough PRJNA439790.\nRESULTS\nMetabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates\nof B. distachyon\nMetabolomics analysis of lyophilized root exudates revealed\nthe presence of numerous plant metabolites, 86 of which were\nidentified by matching their spectra to the LECO/Fiehn\nMetabolomics library (Supplementary Table 3). These\nmetabolites included (i) carbohydrates and their derivatives\n(glucose, fructose, xylose, sucrose, trehalose, maltose, galactose,\nand others); (ii) sugar alcohols (b-mannosylglycerate, myoinositol,\ngalactinol, 2-deoxyerythritol, ribitol, threitol and\ncellobitol); (iii) amino acids and derivatives (glutamine,\ntyrosine, glutamic acid, asparagine, aspartic acid, valine,\nphenylalanine, isoleucine, glycine, serine, proline, leucine,\ntryptophan, cysteine, methionine, citrulline, and others); (iv)\norganic acids (aconitic, allantoic, g-aminobutyric, azelaic, citric,\nfumaric, 2-furoic, D-glyceric, 3-hydroxypropionic, a-ketoadipic,\nmalic, methylmalonic, nicotinic, quinic, succinic, threonic);\nand (v) assorted metabolites including heterocyclic compounds,\nphenolics, and biogenic amines, etc (3-hydroxypyridine,\nmaleimide, noradrenaline, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoate,\n5-methoxytryptamine, uracil, aminomalonic acid, palmitic acid,\nand urea). Results of the analysis also revealed that root exudates\nof B. distachyon contain hydroxyectoine and the quaternary\namine (QA) glycine betaine (Supplementary Figure 1).\nPhylogenetic and Pangenome Analyses\nof Pseudomonas Strains Used in the\nStudy\nWe used a set of phylogenetic markers suggested by Mulet et al.\n(2010) to investigate the relatedness of the eight strains used in\nthis study to distinct lineages recognized within the P. fluorescens\nspecies complex. The multilocus sequence analysis based on\nthe concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S\nrRNA), gyrB, rpoB, and rpoD identified R1-43-08 (along with\nstrains 2-79 and SBW25) as a member of the P. fluorescens\nsubgroup (Figure 1). The rest of the strains clustered closely with\nfour additional subgroups of the P. fluorescens complex, namely\nP. corrugata (strains Q2-87 and Q8r1-96), P. koreensis (Pf0-1),\nP. protegens (Pf-5), and P. chlororaphis (30–84). The genomes of\nthe eight rhizosphere Pseudomonas strains varied in size by 1.43\nmegabase (ranging from 5.65 to 7.07 Mb) and contained between\n5,166 and 6,363 protein-coding genes (Figure 2A). The shared\ngene content was characterized with OrthoMCL, which uses allagainst-\nall BLASTp followed by the Markov Cluster algorithm to\nidentify protein groups shared between the compared genomes,\nas well as groups representing species-specific gene expansion\nfamilies (Li et al., 2003). The pangenome analysis revealed a\ncore comprised of approximately 3,179 orthologs that were\nshared among all strains and represented 50.0% to 61.5%\nof each predicted proteome (Figures 2A,B). The non-core\npangenome contained genes shared by two or more (but not\nall) strains and contained between 1,482 and 2,080 orthologs,\nwhich corresponded to 28.7–36.3% of individual proteomes. The\nrest of the predicted protein-coding genes were strain-specific\nsingletons that comprised 7.5% to 15.1% of the strain’s predicted\nproteomes. In respect to divergence from the core genome, strain\nPf-5 was found to possess the highest proportion of unique genes\n(n = 949) followed by 2-79 (n = 887). The entire pangenome of\nthe Pseudomonas strains encompassed over 12,000 homolog and\nsingleton gene families.\nFurther homolog family-based comparisons identified Q8r1-\n96 and R1-43-08 as the most distantly related strains, with\n3349 shared homologs (Supplementary Table 4A). Q8r1-96 and\nQ2-87, which shared 4,489 homologs, were the most closely\nrelated strains. The partitioning of homolog gene families into\nthe core, non-core, and singleton parts of the pangenome agreed\nwith phylogenetic relationships of the strains deduced from the\nanalysis of a selected subset of COGs (Clusters of Orthologous\nGroups) (Figure 2C and Supplementary Tables 4B,C). The\nCOG-based phylogeny supported the multilocus sequence\nanalysis and revealed that the eight Pseudomonas strains form\nthree distinct clusters, the first of which contained 2-79, R1-30-\n84, and SBW25. The second cluster included Q8r1-96 and Q2-87,\nwhereas the third encompassed strains 30-84, Pf-5, and Pf0-1.\nCorrelating the Composition of Root\nExudates With Metabolic Profiles of\nPseudomonas Strains\nWe used the Phenotype MicroArray PM1 and PM2 plates to\nprofile the eight Pseudomonas strains for the utilization of\n190 different carbon sources. Results of the analysis identified\n90 compounds that supported growth and clustered by their\nintensities of utilization into three distinct groups (Figure 3).\nGroup I was comprised of 30 highly metabolized carbon\nsources, which included several amino acids and intermediates of\nglycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, and citrate cycle. Approximately\nhalf of these compounds were catabolized by all eight strains,\nand included several organic acids (fumaric, citric, gluconic,\nmalic, and pyroglutamic), amino acids (Glu, Asn, Gln, Asp, Pro,\nAla, and g-aminobutyric acid), carbohydrates (glucose, mannose,\nand mannitol), and the purine nucleoside inosine. Group II\nwas composed of 44 chemically diverse carbon sources that\nwere variably utilized by the strains. These compounds were\ncarbohydrates, organic acids, amino acids, phenolics, and polyols,\nand included known compatible solutes and intermediates of\nmetabolism of pentoses, galactose, starch, and sucrose. Group\nIII encompassed the rest of the Phenotype MicroArray test\npanel and contained compounds that were not catabolized\nby the tested strains. Among several notable exceptions were\na-hydroxyglutamic acid- g-lactone, putrescine, and itaconic,\ncitramalic, and succinamic acids, which supported the growth\nof strains 2-79, 30-84, Pf-5, and SBW25.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nFIGURE 1 | Neighbor joining phylogeny showing the relationship of the eight strains used in this study (indicated by red triangles) to different species of the\nP. fluorescens complex. The phylogeny was established based on the concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S rRNA), gyrB (subunit B of DNA\ngyrase), rpoB (b subunit of RNA polymerase), and rpoD (sigma 70 factor subunit of RNA polymerase). Distance matrices were calculated by the Jukes-Cantor\nmethod. Colored circles on tree nodes indicate bootstrap values (1,000 replicates) that vary between 60% (smallest circle) and 100% (largest circles).\nB. distachyon Bd21. Interestingly, many carbon sources from\nthe Phenotype MicroArray panel were also present in the root\nexudates of B. distachyon Bd21, and some of these compounds\n(glucose, mannose, galactose, fructose, g-aminobutyric acid,\naspartic acid, citric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, quinic acid,\nalanine, glutamine, and glutamic acid) were catabolized by all\nstrains used in this study, while others (e.g., xylose, trehalose,\nm-inositol) were actively utilized only by certain organisms\n(Figure 3). The comparison of catabolic profiles across the\neight studied Pseudomonas strains revealed the presence of three\ndistinct clusters. The first cluster contained strains Q8r1-96 and\nQ2-87, which consumed very similar sets of carbon sources,\nas well as strain Pf0-1. The second cluster was composed of\n2-79, R1-43-08, SBW25, and 30-84, whereas the third cluster\nwas represented by a single strain, Pf-5. The overall similarity\nof the catabolic profiles partially agreed with the separation\nof the strains into different subgroups of the P. fluorescens\ncomplex (see above).\nAnalysis of the RNA-seq Results\nIn order to understand the cellular responses of rhizosphere\nPseudomonas to plant exometabolites, we analyzed the\ntranscriptome changes in cultures grown in the presence of\nroot exudates. Under field conditions, rhizobacteria colonize\nplant roots in the form of surface-attached microaerobic biofilms\n(Hojberg et al., 1999). To mimic these conditions, the eight\nPseudomonas strains were grown statically at 72% air saturation\nin 21C-glucose medium amended with root exudates and then\nprocessed to extract total RNA (Supplementary Figure 2).\nA total of 995 million raw sequencing reads were generated from\nthe RNA samples by using the Illumina HiSeq-2500 platform,\naveraging 20.7 million reads per sample. The removal of lowquality\nand rRNA sequences resulted in a total of 793 million\nfiltered reads that were mapped onto the eight Pseudomonas\ngenomes with a mean of 7.48 million mapped fragments per\ngenome. The differentially abundant transcripts were identified\nby setting a p value of 0.05 (adjusted for multiple testing) and\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 6 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

(B) The gradual expansion of\nthe pangenome (blue color) and contraction of the core genome (green color) following the sequential addition of genomes from the dataset. Box plots indicate the\n25th and 75th percentiles and medians (horizontal lines) with whiskers corresponding to the 10th and 90th percentiles. The input order was randomized to avoid any\nbias due to the sequential addition of new genomes. The pangenome size increases steadily without reaching a plateau even after the addition of 11,939\nnon-redundant gene families. At the same time, the core genome converged to 3,179 genes. (C) The pangenome-based phylogenomic analysis of the studied\nstrains. Here, the pangenome was defined with OrthoMCL, and orthologous gene sets were then partitioned into the core, singleton, and non-core (the remaining\northolog sets) categories. These categories were calculated for each node in the Maximum Likelihood species tree, using the set of genomes for which that node\nrepresents the ancestor. The results of the ortholog partitioning are shown in pie charts placed at tree nodes. Numbers indicate bootstrap support values. The\nanalysis was conducted in KBase (Arkin et al., 2018).\nthe log2 fold-change (FC) threshold \u2000\u2000 2.0 (Figure 4 and\nSupplementary Tables 5–12). When compared with the control\nconditions, an average of 204 genes per strain were differentially\nexpressed in the presence of root exudates, with the highest\n(n = 425) and lowest (n = 112) numbers observed, respectively,\nin SBW25 and Q2-87 (Figure 4). Overall, more genes were\ninduced than repressed in response to exudates, but the actual\nnumbers in each category varied substantially depending on the\nidentity of the Pseudomonas strain. In most strains, the bulk of\nthe differentially expressed genes was almost equally distributed\nbetween the core (mean, 48.2%) and non-core (mean, 45.8%)\nparts of the genome, whereas the strain-specific singleton genes\nconstituted on average only 5.9% (Figure 4B). One notable\nexception was observed in Q8r1-96, where all differentially\nexpressed genes belonged to the core (73.8%) and non-core\n(26.2%) parts of the genome. Another notable pattern was\nobserved in R1-43-08, where the majority of genes affected by\nthe presence of root exudate fell into the non-core category\n(56.3%). The highest proportion of differentially expressed\nsingletons (11.3 and 10.4%, respectively) was identified in\nstrains SBW25 and Pf-5.\nWe further explored how the identified differentially\nexpressed genes were distributed across genomes of the eight\nstudied rhizosphere strains. The pairwise BLASTp comparisons\nidentified 2-79 and SBW25 as two strains that shared the highest\nnumber of genes (n = 101) induced or repressed in response\nto root exudates (Table 1). The second pair of strains with\na significant number of similar differentially expressed genes\n(n = 86) was Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, which was followed by Pf0-1\nand 30-84, which shared 56 differentially expressed genes. These\npatterns of shared genes were also observed when the results of\nthe pairwise BLASTp comparisons were converted into a binary\ngene presence/absence matrix, which was then subjected to\ncluster analysis using a UPGMA algorithm based on Sorensen’s\ndissimilarity index or examined by non-metric multidimensional\nscaling (NMDS) (Figure 5).\nThe differentially expressed Pseudomonas genes were\nsubjected to Blast2Go analysis and Gene Ontology (GO)\nannotation (Figure 6). Metabolic process, catalytic activity,\nand membrane were the most common annotation terms\nacross the three primary GO term categories (i.e., biological\nprocess, molecular function, and cellular component). A total\nof 1,694 GO terms was assigned to 805 upregulated genes, with\nthe majority of the GO terms related to molecular function\n(682, 40.3%), followed by biological process (669, 39.5%), and\ncellular component (343, 20.2%). In the 539 downregulated gene\ncategory, 1,101 GO terms were assigned to biological process\n(420, 38.1%), molecular function (417, 37.9%), and cellular\ncomponent (264, 24.0%). Within biological process, metabolic\nprocess, cellular process, localization, response to stimulus, and\nregulation were over-represented. Within molecular function,\nthe largest proportion was assigned to catalytic activity, binding,\nand transporter activity categories. Within cellular component,\nthe majority were assigned to membrane, membrane part, cell,\nand cell part categories. Across the eight strains, 37–42% of\ndifferentially expressed genes had no Gene Ontology IDs and\nencoded various conserved hypothetical proteins.\nFunctional Classification of Shared\nDifferentially Expressed Genes\nThe interrogation of RNA-seq data revealed multiple cellular\npathways that were differentially regulated in bacterial cultures\nincubated with root exudates (Supplementary Figures 3, 4).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 7 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nFIGURE 3 | Biolog Phenotype MicroArray profiling the eight rhizosphere\nPseudomonas strains used in the study. The hierarchical clustering analysis\nwas carried out using the average linkage method with Euclidean distances.\nCarbon sources identified by red arrowheads were also detected in the sterile\nroot exudates of B. distachyon Bd21.\nAlthough none of these differentially regulated pathways were\nshared by all eight strains, the cross-strain comparisons revealed\nseveral types of common and specific transcriptomic responses\nthat were elicited by the presence of plant exometabolites\n(Table 2). The visual representation of core gene expression\npatterns is provided in Supplementary Figure 5, which\nshows heatmaps of expression profiles and p-adj values for\ncore genes shared by the studied strains. The figure is\naccompanied by Supplementary Table 13 that lists predicted\nfunctions of genes constituting the four distinct clusters\nobserved after hierarchical clustering of gene expression\nvalues. The first category of shared differentially expressed\npathways functioned in the uptake and catabolism of selected\ncarbohydrates, quaternary ammonium compounds (QAs), and\nphenolics. All strains except for R1-43-08, responded to root\nexudates by inducing the fructose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate\n(PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTSFru). The\ncomponents of this system are encoded by a conserved\noperon and include the cytoplasmic polyprotein EI/HPr/EIIAFru\n(FruB), the 1-phosphofructokinase FruK, and the fructosespecific\npermease EIIBC (FruA) (Chavarria et al., 2016). The\nPTSFru system functions by acquiring high-energy phosphates\nfrom PEP and sequentially passing them, via the EI/HPr/EIIAFru\ndomains of FruB, to the EIIB component of FruA. The\nphosphates are ultimately transferred by the EIIC transporter\nto fructose yielding fructose 1-phosphate, which is channeled\ninto the central metabolic pathways through the action of the\nphosphofructokinase FruK.\nIn all strains except for Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, the exposure to root\nexudates resulted in the induction of two genes adjacent to the\nfru cluster that encoded a Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS)\ntransporter and an L-arabinonate dehydratase (Table 2). These\ngenes are predicted to participate in the uptake and catabolism\nof L-arabinose, where L-arabinonate dehydratase plays an\nimportant role by converting L-arabinonate to 2-dehydro-3-\ndeoxy-L-arabinonate (Rahman et al., 2017). In SBW25, R1-\n43-08, and Q2-87, we also observed the induction of genes\nencoding components of the AraFGH complex, an ATP-Binding\nCassette (ABC) superfamily transporter involved in the import of\narabinose into the cell (Supplementary Tables 6, 7, 9). Finally, all\nstrains except SBW25 and R1-43-08 responded to the presence\nof exudates by upregulating a conserved gene encoding an\naldose epimerase superfamily protein. Such enzymes equilibrate\nalpha- and beta-anomers of aldoses and ensure that stereospecific\nenzymes involved in the metabolism of free sugars do not act as\nmetabolic bottlenecks (Abayakoon et al., 2018). Although some\naldose epimerases have been linked to specific pathways, the\nPseudomonas gene identified in this study could not be assigned\nto a particular metabolic process based on sequence analysis and\ngenomic location.\nSeveral Pseudomonas strains responded to the presence\nof root exudates by upregulating genes involved in the\nuptake and catabolism of myo-inositol and possibly other\nstereoisomers of inositol (Table 2). The upregulated catabolic\ngenes encode the dehydrogenase IolG, which oxidizes myoinositol\nto its corresponding ketone, as well as IolE, IolD, IolB,\nand IolC that collectively convert the 2-keto-myo-inositol to\nacetyl-CoA and the glycolysis intermediate dihydroxyacetone\nphosphate (Yoshida et al., 2008; Kohler et al., 2011).

The cross-genome comparisons revealed\nthat in all studied strains except for Pf0-1, components\nof the myo-inositol utilization pathway were encoded\nwithin a well-conserved gene cluster which, in addition to\ncatabolic and transport functions, also encodes a dedicated\ntranscriptional repressor.\nAll studied strains of Pseudomonas carry multiple genes\ninvolved in scavenging the quaternary ammonium compounds\ncholine, glycine betaine (GB), carnitine, choline-O-sulfate, and\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 9 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

Many of these genes were\ndifferentially expressed, including those encoding parts of the\nABC transporter CbcXWV, which is predicted to function in\nthe uptake of choline under water-replete conditions (Table 2).\nAmong enzymes induced in the presence of root exudates were\nthe choline dehydrogenase BetA, which converts choline to\nglycine betaine and a network of enzymes (i.e., the Rieske family\noxygenase GbcAB, the dimethyglycine demethylase DgcAB, and\nthe sarcosine oxidase SoxBDAG) that sequentially convert GB\nto glycine. In 2-79 and SBW25, this group of differentially\nregulated genes also included an AraC-family transcriptional\nactivator GbdR, which perceives intercellular levels of GB and\ninduces genes involved in the transport and catabolism of\nglycine betaine and detoxification of the catabolic byproducts\n(Hampel et al., 2014).\nThe last category of activated catabolic pathways included the\ncatechol branch of the b-ketoadipate pathway for the degradation\nof aromatic compounds. In strains 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5,\ngrowth on root exudates resulted in upregulation of catechol-\n1,2-dioxygenase, muconate cycloisomerase, and muconolactone\nisomerase, which collectively cleave the catechol ring and\nconvert it to b-ketoadipate enol-lactone (Harwood and Parales,\n1996). Finally, analysis of the P. synxantha 2-79 transcriptome\nidentified an induction of benABC genes encoding subunits\nof benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase, an oxidoreductase that generates\ncatechol from benzoate.\nIn addition to various catabolic pathways, the exposure to root\nexudates also induced several genes involved in the homeostasis\nof copper (Table 2). Four of these genes form a conserved cluster\nin genomes of the strains and encode the periplasmic coppersensing\ntwo-component system CinRS, the plastocyanin/azurinlike\nprotein CinA, and the NADPH-dependent pre-Q0 reductase\nCinQ. Also, in strains Q2-87, 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, we observed\nupregulation of a conserved operon encoding the multicopper\noxidase CopA, the periplasmic copper-binding protein CopC, the\ninner membrane protein CopD, and outer membrane protein\nCopB. In several Gram-negative bacteria, these Cop proteins are\nthought to have dual functions and participate both in the uptake\nof essential copper as well as in the sequestration of excess copper\nin the periplasm and outer membrane.\nThe analysis of shared downregulated pathways revealed that\nmost of the strains respond to the presence of root exudates by\nrepressing genes involved in the uptake and catabolism of sulfur\ncompounds (Table 2). In strains SBW25, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96,\nQ2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, this response involved the ssuEADCB\noperon responsible for the utilization of alkanesulfonates\nas sulfur sources. The ssu operon is highly conserved in\nfluorescent pseudomonads and encodes the FMNH2-dependent\nmonooxygenase SsuD and the NAD (P)H-dependent FMN\nreductase SsuE, which together catalyze the desulfonation of\nalkanesulfonates. Also, the ssu locus contains genes for the\nmolybdopterin-binding protein SsuF and the alkanesulfonatespecific\nABC-type transporter consisting of the sulfonate\nsubstrate-binding protein SsuA, sulfonate permease protein\nSsuC, and sulfonate transport ATP-binding protein SsuB. Finally,\nin R1-43-08, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, growth on root exudates\ncoincided with repression of the tauABCD operon, which\nallows these strains to utilize taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonate)\nas a sulfur source. The repressed tau genes encoded the\n2-oxoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenase TauD and\nsubstrate-binding, ATP-binding, and permease components of\nthe taurine-specific ABC transporter TauABC.\nOther Differentially Expressed Pathways\nIn addition to their effect on several shared cellular pathways,\ngrowth on root exudates resulted in the induction or repression of\nnumerous strain-specific genes. In closely related P. synxantha 2-\n79 and P. fluorescens SBW25, we observed differential expression\nof genes involved in energy metabolism, transport of amino\nacids, and surface attachment (Supplementary Tables 5, 6).\nOther notable differentially expressed pathways included 2–\n79 gene clusters that encode enzymes for the catabolism of\ntrehalose, a prophage, and toxin/antitoxin system, as well as the\nSBW25 operon predicted to control the synthesis of the capsular\nexopolysaccharide colonic acid. The response of Pseudomonas sp.\nR1-43-08 to root exudates also involved differential expression\nof different energy metabolism pathways. In addition, we\nobserved the upregulation of genes involved in the uptake and\ncatabolism of xylose (also upregulated in 2–79) and repression\nof enzymes for the biosynthesis of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid\nand assimilation of inorganic sulfur and L-cysteine biosynthesis\n(Supplementary Table 7).\nThe analysis of the Q8r1-96 transcriptome revealed\nperturbation of different metabolic pathways including genes\nencoding components of cytochrome C oxidase, transport\nand catabolism of sorbitol/mannitol, metabolism of butanoic\nacid, and biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides alginate and\npoly-b-1-6-N-acetylglucosamine (Supplementary Table 8). In\nP. fluorescens Q2-87, we identified differential expression of\ngenes involved in metabolism of galactose, tryptophan, tyrosine,\nglycine, serine, and threonine (Supplementary Table 9),\nwhile in P. chlororaphis 30-84, growth on exudates activated\nthe biosynthesis of molybdopterin cofactor, catabolism of\ngalactonate and acetoin, and uptake and catabolism of putrescine\n(Supplementary Table 10). The response of P. protegens Pf-5 to\nroot exudates involved upregulation of acetoin dehydrogenase,\nwhich converts acetoin to acetaldehyde and acetyl-CoA, as\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 10 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

The terms were derived from 93 different functional groups (GO subcategories level 4). The GO terms were assigned with Blast2GO (Conesa\nand Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al., 2018). On a WEGO histogram, the percentage of 100 is defined as the total number of genes assigned a GO\nterm. However, the subcategories do not add up to 100% because many genes fall into more than one functional class and are therefore annotated by multiple GO\nterms.\nwell as pathways for the utilization of glycolate and putrescine\n(Supplementary Table 11). Also induced were genes for\nthe production of pyrrolnitrin and PhlG hydrolase, which\nmodulate the metabolic loads attributed to the synthesis of\n2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol. The differentially expressed genes of\nP. fluorescens Pf0-1 included, among others, operons encoding\ncytochrome C oxidase and enzymes for catabolism of malonic\nacid (Supplementary Table 12). Yet another interesting\nfinding involved the induction of assorted genes acting in the\nhomeostasis of iron and defense against reactive oxygen species\n(ROS). We observed activation of iron dicitrate transporters\n(SBW25 and 30-84), genes for the biosynthesis of siderophores\nornicorrugatin (SBW25) and pyochelin (Pf-5), heme-degrading\nenzymes (2–79, 30–84), TonB siderophore receptors, and\ncomponents of the energy-transducing inner membrane\ncomplex TonB-ExbB-ExbD (2–79 and Pf-5). The differentially\nexpressed ROS defense pathways were represented by different\ncatalases in strains 2–79, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and\nPf-5 and organic hydroperoxide resistance proteins in strains\nSBW25 and R1-43-08.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nsoil microorganisms. Our results were in agreement with a\nrecent report of 27 different sugars, amino acids, and organic\nacids in Brachypodium exudates (Kawasaki et al., 2016). We\nconfirmed the presence of exometabolites identified in that\nstudy, along with dozens of additional analytes that were\nidentified by matching their mass-spectra and retention indices\nto the LECO/Fiehn Metabolomics library (Supplementary\nTable 3). The complementation of the metabolomic analysis\nwith profiling of the bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays\nrevealed that a substantial proportion of the characterized\nexudate constituents were catabolized by a collection of eight\nPseudomonas strains from across the P. fluorescens group that is\nknown to form associations with plant roots. The amendment\nof Pseudomonas cultures with root exudates caused changes in\nthe expression of multiple genes encoding catabolic and anabolic\nenzymes, predicted transporters, transcriptional regulators, stress\nresponse, and conserved hypothetical proteins. In most strains,\nthese differentially expressed genes were almost equally split\nbetween the core and variable genome regions, mirroring\nthe substantial strain-to-strain variation in the genome size\nand gene content within the P. fluorescens species complex\n(Loper et al., 2012).\nThe analysis of transcriptome responses to root exudates\nrevealed several types of cellular pathways present in the strains\nused in this study. The first category of such pathways was\ninvolved in the catabolism of carbohydrates such as fructose,\narabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, trehalose, and galactose. Among\nthese catabolic traits, the ability to utilize fructose as a carbon\nsource is highly conserved among fluorescent pseudomonads.\nIn contrast, growth on arabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, and\ntrehalose is variably present and was traditionally used to\ndifferentiate species and biovars within the P. fluorescens\ngroup (Barrett et al., 1986). We speculate that such variably\ndistributed pathways contribute to the differential affinity of\npseudomonads toward host plants and/or to determine which\nstrains flourish in response to growing roots and changing\nenvironments. Several independent studies have confirmed\nthe importance of carbohydrate catabolism pathways for the\nbiology of rhizosphere pseudomonads. For example, in vivo\nexpression technology (IVET) profiling of P. fluorescens SBW25\nidentified xylose isomerase among genome regions essential\nfor the colonization of sugar beet seedlings (Liu et al., 2015),\nwhereas a genome-wide Tn-Seq screen of Pseudomonas simiae\nidentified genes for the catabolism of myo-inositol among traits\nessential for the colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana roots\n(Cole et al., 2017).\nThe response of rhizosphere Pseudomonas to Brachypodium\nroot exudates also involved pathways for the uptake and\nmetabolism of amino acids. We observed differential\nexpression of genes encoding the hydrophobic (HAAT) and\npolar (PAAT) amino acid uptake transporters in strains\n2-79, SBW25, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5. Other related genes\nencoded enzymes for the catabolism of valine and glutamic\nacid (2-79); metabolism of tryptophan, glycine, serine, and\nthreonine (Q2-87); and biosynthesis of methionine (Q8r1-\n96). It is plausible that the abundance of amino acids in\nroot exudates is also linked to the repression of pathways\ninvolved in the catabolism of sulfonates and taurine that\nwas observed in several strains (Table 2). Although the\npreferred source of sulfur for P. fluorescens is unknown, in the\nclosely related P. aeruginosa, the sulfur starvation response\nis triggered by the growth on any sulfur compound other\nthan sulfate, thiocyanate, and cysteine (Hummerjohann et al.,\n1998). This fact, together with the presence of cysteine and\ncystine in the root exudates, suggest that root exudates of\nBrachypodium may serve as an important source of sulfur for\nrhizosphere Pseudomonas. These findings also agree well with\nthe reported scarcity of inorganic sulfate in the soil, and the\npresence of sulfur mostly in the form of organic compounds,\nincluding amino acids, proteins, sulfate esters, and sulfonates\n(Autry and Fitzgerald, 1990).\nAnother interesting result of this study was the concerted\nactivation of copper and iron homeostasis pathways observed\nin all of the Pseudomonas strains used in this work. In bacteria,\nan excess of copper is toxic and triggers oxidative stress due to\nthe formation of free radicals, as well as disruption of protein\nmetalation and stability of iron-sulfur clusters (Bondarczuk\nand Piotrowska-Seget, 2013). On the other hand, copper is an\nessential trace element used as a cofactor in different enzymes.\nSimilarly, although elevated levels of iron cause redox stress, this\nelement is also found in active energy metabolism enzymes and is\ncrucial for bacterial growth (Andrews et al., 2003). The analysis\nof metal homeostasis genes identified in this study suggests\nthat their induction was likely triggered by the deficiency of\ncopper and iron in bacterial cultures grown in the presence of\nroot exudates. We attribute this effect to the ability of some\ncomponents of root exudates to chelate soil metals.\nDespite the abundance of iron in the soil, its bioavailability\nis limited due to the low solubility of Fe (III) oxyhydrates\nat neutral pH. The non-graminaceous plants circumvent this\nproblem by acidifying the rhizosphere and secreting flavins,\nphenolics, and organic acids that chelate iron. The reduction\nof these ferric chelates releases soluble ferrous iron taken up\nby root cells (Kobayashi and Nishizawa, 2012). Graminaceous\nplants, like Brachypodium, acquire iron by secreting into the\nsoil non-protein amino acids of the mugineic acid (MA) group,\nwhich act as Fe (III)-chelating phytosiderophores. In addition to\niron, low-molecular-weight organic acids and phytosiderophores\nbind other divalent and trivalent metals (including copper) and\ncontribute to heavy-metal tolerance in plants (Chen et al., 2017).\nIt is plausible that the presence of these plant exometabolites\nis responsible for the deficit of iron and copper observed in\nPseudomonas cultures grown in the presence of root exudates.\nThese results further underscore the importance of diverse and\nredundant metal homeostasis pathways found in genomes of the\nP. fluorescens group for the ability of these organisms to colonize\nand persist in the plant rhizosphere.\nRecently, Klonowska et al. (2018) examined transcriptomic\nresponses of symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria to root\nexudates of the legume plant Mimosa pundica, which has\nan unusual ability to support both alpha- (Rhizobium) and\nbeta-rhizobia (Cupriavidus and Burkholderia). Using RNA-seq,\nthe authors characterized genes involved in the perception of\nroot exudates in the nodulating bacteria Burkholderia phymatum\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 14 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nSTM815, Cupriavidus taiwanensis LMG19424, and Rhizobium\nmesoamericanum STM3625. Interestingly, the analysis of\ndifferentially expressed genes revealed induction of pathways\ninvolved in the catabolism of fructose, xylose, myo-inositol,\nand protocatechuate/catechol. Also upregulated were some\ncopper homeostasis, siderophore biosynthesis, and oxidative\nstress genes. Finally, the analytical profiling of M. pundica\nexudates revealed an overlap with Brachypodium in the types of\ncarbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids present. These\nfindings suggest that differentially expressed genes shared by\nmultiple strains of the group P. fluorescens are not unique to\nthe Brachypodium-Pseudomonas system but represent a set\nof conserved cellular pathways involved in the perception of\nplant exometabolites by different clades of rhizosphere-dwelling\nProteobacteria.\nMost strains included in this study were originally selected\nbased on the ability to colonize the rhizosphere and produce\nsecondary metabolites that alleviate the plant stress response\nand/or inhibit soilborne pathogens. It has been suggested\nthat plant metabolites released into the rhizosphere affect\nthe biocontrol activity of plant-beneficial pseudomonads (de\nWerra et al., 2011). We provide further support to this\nhypothesis by demonstrating that in some strains, root exudates\nmodulate the expression of genes for the catabolism of\nthe plant growth-promoting metabolites acetoin and 2,3-\nbutanediol. The exposure to exudates also affected the expression\nof genes for the synthesis of well-characterized antifungal\ncompounds pyrrolnitrin, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, and 2,4-\ndiacetylphloroglucinol. The modulatory effects were strainspecific,\nsuggesting significant differences in the regulatory\nnetworks involved in the perception of plant signals and\nregulation of the production of antibiotics and growthpromoting\nmetabolites.\nThe final significant finding of this study was the induction\nof catabolism of quaternary amines (QAs) observed in multiple\nstrains of the P. fluorescens group during growth on root\nexudates. This observation was supported by the detection of\nglycine betaine in the root secretions of B. distachyon. The\npresence of QAs in plant tissues and the capacity of these\nmetabolites to provide stress protection and nutrients to plant\npathogens and symbionts were reported before (Boncompagni\net al., 1999; Chen et al., 2013; Kabbadj et al., 2017), but our\nstudy is among the first to highlight the potential importance of\nthese metabolites for rhizosphere interactions. Pseudomonads do\nnot synthesize QAs de novo but have evolved many pathways to\nscavenge them from eukaryotic hosts, where these metabolites\nare abundant due to the prominence of phosphatidylcholine\nin cellular membranes. Strains of P. fluorescens carry genes\nfor the conversion of choline, carnitine, and glycine betaine to\nglycine, as well as quaternary amine transporters of the BCCT\nand ABC families that are also conserved in the opportunistic\nhuman pathogen P. aeruginosa and the plant pathogen P. syringae\n(Galvao et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2013; Wargo, 2013b).\nIn P. aeruginosa, choline catabolism genes are essential for\nthe ability of this pathogen to persist during lung infection\n(Wargo, 2013a). Similarly, a P. syringae mutant deficient in\nBetT, OpuC, and CbcXWV quaternary amine transporters had\nreduced fitness during colonization of bean and soybean leaves\nunder greenhouse and field conditions (Chen et al., 2013).\nDepending on water availability, P. aeruginosa and P. syringae\ncatabolize exogenously supplied QAs as carbon and nitrogen\nsources or accumulate them as osmoprotectants (Chen et al.,\n2013; Wargo, 2013b). Our ongoing work in P. synxantha 2–\n79 unraveled similar physiological responses and demonstrated\nthat QA transporters function differentially and redundantly\nin the uptake of quaternary amines as nutrients (Pablo and\nMavrodi, unpublished). In contrast, under water stress, the QAs\ncholine, betaine, and carnitine are accumulated preferentially for\nosmoprotection. Under drought stress, a 2–79 mutant devoid\nof all known QA transporters was less competitive in the\ncolonization of the Brachypodium rhizosphere than its wild-type\nparental strain. Interestingly, our metabolomic profiling of root\nexudates also revealed proline, glutamine, and hydroxyectoine.\nThese metabolites act as compatible solutes in different groups\nof microorganisms (Yancey et al., 1982; Empadinhas and da\nCosta, 2008), suggesting an important role of root exudates\nin the ability of Pseudomonas to persist in the rhizosphere of\ndrought-stressed plants.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe original contributions presented in the study are publicly\navailable.

Plant roots secrete carbon-rich rhizodeposits containing primary and\nsecondary low molecular weight metabolites, lysates, and mucilages. These exudates\nprovide nutrients for soil microorganisms and modulate their affinity to host plants, but\nmolecular details of this process are largely unresolved. We addressed this gap by\nfocusing on the molecular dialog between eight well-characterized beneficial strains\nof the Pseudomonas fluorescens group and Brachypodium distachyon, a model for\neconomically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops of the grass family. We\ncollected and analyzed root exudates of B. distachyon and demonstrated the presence\nof multiple carbohydrates, amino acids, organic acids, and phenolic compounds. The\nsubsequent screening of bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays revealed that many\nof these metabolites provide carbon and energy for the Pseudomonas strains. RNAseq\nprofiling of bacterial cultures amended with root exudates revealed changes in the\nexpression of genes encoding numerous catabolic and anabolic enzymes, transporters,\ntranscriptional regulators, stress response, and conserved hypothetical proteins. Almost\nhalf of the differentially expressed genes mapped to the variable part of the strains’\npangenome, reflecting the importance of the variable gene content in the adaptation of\nP. fluorescens to the rhizosphere lifestyle.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nINTRODUCTION\nPlants are meta-organisms or holobionts that rely in part on\ntheir microbiome for specific functions and traits. The ability\nof the plant microbiome to influence plant development, vigor,\nhealth, and fitness in response to abiotic stressors associated\nwith global climate change is documented by numerous studies\n(Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009). There is mounting evidence\nthat plants actively recruit beneficial microbiomes, but many\naspects of this process are still very much a black box (Reinhold-\nHurek et al., 2015). The foundation for the differential affinity\nof rhizobacteria toward host plants is built upon complex\nchemical cross talk between microorganisms and plant roots.\nUp to 40% of photosynthetically fixed carbon is released by\nplant roots in the form of exudates and secretions, lysates, and\nmucilages (Curl and Truelove, 1986; Lynch, 1990; Whipps, 1990;\nBadri and Vivanco, 2009). The release of these compounds is\nactively controlled in response to environmental stimuli, and the\ncomposition of root exudates varies greatly according to plant\nspecies and physiological condition (Lynch, 1990; Nguyen, 2003;\nPhillips et al., 2004; De-la-Pena et al., 2008). The presence and\ncomposition of exudates strongly impact soil microorganisms,\nwhich is consistent with the idea that plants actively select and\nshape their root microbiota (Zolla et al., 2013).\nPrimary root exudates include simple and complex sugars,\namino acids, polypeptides and proteins, organic, aliphatic and\nfatty acids, sterols, and phenolics (Nguyen, 2003; Badri and\nVivanco, 2009; Badri et al., 2009). These compounds serve as\ncarbon and energy sources for rhizobacteria, and the presence\nof the intact corresponding catabolic pathways is essential\nfor competitive colonization of roots and disease suppression\n(Lugtenberg et al., 2001; Kamilova et al., 2005; Lugtenberg and\nKamilova, 2009). Root exudates also contain numerous signal\nmolecules and secondary metabolites, the significance of which\nis only now emerging (Walker et al., 2003; Bais et al., 2005,\n2006). A handful of analyses of plant-induced gene expression\nby transcriptional profiling in vitro (Mark et al., 2005) or in\nthe rhizosphere (Silby and Levy, 2004; Ramos-Gonzalez et al.,\n2005; Matilla et al., 2007; Barret et al., 2009) have identified\nmultiple genes that are differentially regulated by exposure to\nroots or root exudates. Bacterial pathways expressed during\nrhizosphere colonization control utilization of plant-derived\nmetabolites (Simons et al., 1996, 1997; Camacho-Carvajal, 2001;\nLugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), motility and chemotaxis (de\nWeert et al., 2002; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), phase\nvariation (Dekkers et al., 1998; Sanchez-Contreras et al., 2002;\nvan den Broek et al., 2005), outer membrane integrity (de Weert\net al., 2006; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), and the ability\nto sequester limiting resources (Raaijmakers et al., 1995) and\nresist environmental stresses (Sarniguet et al., 1995; Miller and\nWood, 1996; van Veen et al., 1997; Schnider-Keel et al., 2001). In\nits spatial and temporal properties, root colonization resembles\nbiofilm formation, and biofilm-related pathways also have been\nimplicated in adhesion to seeds and roots and rhizosphere\ncolonization (Espinosa-Urgel et al., 2000; Hinsa et al., 2003;\nYousef-Coronado et al., 2008; Fuqua, 2010; Martinez-Gil et al.,\n2010; Nielsen et al., 2011; Zboralski and Filion, 2020). Finally,\nroot exudates strongly affect the expression of diverse plant\ngrowth promotion and biocontrol genes (Vacheron et al., 2013).\nOver the past decade, the genomes of numerous rhizosphere\nstrains have been sequenced and analyzed, but functional\ngenomics studies of rhizosphere competence lag behind the\navailability of sequence data.\nThis study explored the molecular dialog between the\nmodel host plant Brachypodium distachyon and several wellcharacterized\nrhizosphere strains of the Pseudomonas fluorescens\ngroup. Brachypodium is a small annual grass originating in semiarid\nregions of the Middle East that has emerged as a prime model\nfor economically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops\nof the grass family (Bevan et al., 2010; Schwartz et al., 2010;\nBrkljacic et al., 2011; Hong et al., 2011; Tyler et al., 2014). The\nbiology, extensive collection of resources, and research tools\nmake B. distachyon an attractive model to investigate interactions\nbetween plants and root-associated microbes. Pseudomonads\nare ubiquitous Gram-negative g-proteobacteria that colonize\neukaryotic hosts and include both commensals and economically\nimportant pathogens of plants and animals (Moore et al.,\n2006; Schroth et al., 2006; Yahr and Parsek, 2006). The genus\nPseudomonas currently comprises > 100 named species that have\nbeen separated based on multilocus sequence analysis into 14\nspecies groups (Garrido-Sanz et al., 2016; Hesse et al., 2018).\nThe P. fluorescens group is the most diverse regarding both\nthe genetic distances within it, the number of species and the\nlarge pangenome that makes up > 50% of the pangenome\nof the genus as a whole (Loper et al., 2012). The group also\nencompasses an unusually high proportion of strains that inhabit\nthe plant rhizosphere and possess plant growth promoting and\nbiocontrol properties. Naylor et al. (2017) profiled bacterial\ncommunities associated with root tissues and rhizosphere of\n18 different plant species of the Poaceae family. That study\nidentified Pseudomonas among taxa constituting the core grass\nroot microbiome and demonstrated that these bacteria were\nenriched in C3 plants, including wheat, rye, barley, oat, and\nBrachypodium. We confirmed the capacity of B. distachyon\nBd21 to serve as a host for rhizobacteria of the P. fluorescens\ngroup in preliminary greenhouse assays with biocontrol strains\nP. synxantha 2-79, P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96, and P. protegens\nPf-5. Results of these experiments revealed that all strains\nsuccessfully established and colonized the roots of Brachypodium\n(Supplementary Table 1).\nIn this study, we focused on eight well-studied strains\nof the P. fluorescens complex that are supported by years\nof studies, numerous refereed publications, and high-quality\ngenome sequences. By profiling transcriptomes of these strains\nduring growth in root exudates of B. distachyon, we revealed the\ndiversity of cellular pathways and physiological responses that\nunderlie the establishment of mutualistic interactions between\nbeneficial rhizobacteria and the host plant. Our results also\nconfirmed that root exudates contain carbohydrates, amino acids,\norganic acids, and phenolics that serve as carbon and energy\nsources for rhizobacteria. The root exudates also contained\nosmoprotectants that may help microorganisms to persist in the\nrhizosphere of drought-stressed plants.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nthe variable genome in adaptation of individual strains of\nPseudomonas to the rhizosphere lifestyle.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacterial Strains Used in the Study\nThe eight Pseudomonas strains used for this study are\nP. synxantha 2-79 (Thomashow and Weller, 1988), P. fluorescens\nSBW25 (Silby et al., 2009), Pseudomonas sp. R1-43-08 (Parejko\net al., 2012), P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96 (Raaijmakers and Weller,\n1998), P. fluorescens Q2-87 (Bangera and Thomashow, 1996),\nP. chlororaphis 30-84 (Thomashow et al., 1990), P. fluorescens\nPf0-1 (Silby et al., 2009), and P. protegens Pf-5 (Howell and\nStipanovic, 1980). The selected organisms have been studied\nextensively for their role in biological control and plant\ngrowth promotion (Supplementary Table 2). The strains were\nmaintained in the laboratory as frozen stocks (\U0010000080\u2000C) and\nroutinely cultured in King’s medium B (King et al., 1954) or\n21C medium, which contained (per 1 L): 1.0 g of NH4Cl, 3.5 g\nof Na2HPO4\u20002H2O, 2.8 g of KH2PO4, 3.0 g of glucose, and\n20 ml of a microelement solution (Smibert and Kreig, 1994;\nHalverson and Firestone, 2000).\nPropagation of Plants and Collection of\nRoot Exudates\nB. distachyon Bd21 was established from seed material obtained\nfrom the USDA-ARS Plant Germplasm Introduction and Testing\nResearch Unit (Pullman, WA, United States). Brachypodium\nseeds were imbibed for 3 days at 4\u2000C and sown in 7 \u2000 7 cm\npots filled with Sunshine Potting Mix #4 (Sun Gro Horticulture,\nAgawam, MA, United States). Plants were grown in an IR-\n89X (Percival Scientific, Perry, IA, United States) controlled\nenvironment chamber retrofitted with 6500K and 3000K T5 54W\ngrow lights (Spectralux) under a 20-h light, 24\u2000C/4-h dark, 18\u2000C\ncycle. Plants were watered and fertilized with Jack’s professional\nwater-soluble fertilizer (20:20:20) (JR Peters, Allentown, PA,\nUnited States). After 12 weeks and plant senescence, seeds\nwere collected, processed, and stored under desiccant and dark\nconditions at room temperature.\nTo collect root exudates, seeds of B. distachyon Bd21 were\nsurface-sterilized, pregerminated, and placed in sterile 1 L widemouth\nglass jars containing 113 g of 6-mm glass beads and\n25 ml distilled water. Jars were covered with vented caps\nand plants were grown hydroponically in an environmental\ncontrolled growth chamber under conditions described above.\nAfter 6 days, root exudates were extracted from individual\njars and their sterility was confirmed by spotting on nutrient\nagar. Multiple batches of root exudates were collected, filtered\n(0.22 mm), aliquoted in Falcon tubes (10 ml), lyophilized, and\nstored at –80\u2000C.\nMetabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates\nExudates were analyzed for primary metabolites at the Murdock\nMetabolomics Laboratory at Washington State University\n(Pullman, WA, United States). Freeze-dried residues were\nsuspended in 500 ml 50% aqueous acetonitrile and clarified by\ncentrifugation for 20 min at 21,000 \u2000 g and 4\u2000C. The liquid\nchromatography mass spectrometry analysis was conducted\nwith a Synapt G2-S quadrupole-ion mobility spectrometrytime\nof flight mass spectrometer system equipped with an\nacquity ultra-performance liquid chromatograph (UPLC) and\nan acquity photodiode array detector (all from Waters, Milford,\nMA, United States). The exudate metabolites were separated\non a SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC HPLC column (2.1 \u2000 100 mm,\n3 mm) (Milllipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, United States) using\nacetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid as solvent B and water\nwith 0.1% formic acid as solvent A at a flow rate of 400 ml\nmin\U001000001 and the following linear gradient extending over 14 min:\n0 min, 80% B; 4 min, 80% B, 6 min: 10% B; 7.5 min, 10%\nB; 10 min, 80% B; and 14 min, 80% B. Mass spectra were\ncollected in positive ion mode over a range of m/z 50–1,200\nwith a scan time of 0.2 s. The Q-TOF-MS source was at\n3.0 kV and 120\u2000C; the sampling cone at 40 V, desolvation\ntemperature was 250\u2000C; cone gas and desolvation gas flow were\nat 0 and 850 L h\U001000001, respectively. Leucine enkephalin was used\nfor post-acquisition mass correction. Target compounds were\nvisualized using selected ion chromatograms at 0.05 Da window\nwidth. The compound identification was based on comparison\nof chromatographic behavior and accurate masses to those of\nauthentic standards.\nFor gas chromatography, derivatization was carried out using\na modification of the procedure of Lee and Fiehn (2008).\nThe freeze-dried residues were suspended in 950 ml aqueous\nmethanol (84%, v/v) and clarified by centrifugation for 15 min\nat 21,000 \u2000 g at 4\u2000C. The supernatants were spiked with 1\nmg of the internal standard salicylic acid-d6 (C/D/N Isotopes,\nQuebec, Canada) and dried in vacuo. The dry residues were\nsuspended in 10 ml of O-methoxylamine hydrochloride (30 mg\nml\U001000001 in anhydrous pyridine, both from Millipore Sigma) and\nincubated while mixing (1,000 RPM) for 90 min at 30\u2000C.\nSubsequently, samples were derivatized with 90 ml of MSTFA\nwith 1% TMCS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,\nUnited States) for 30 min at 37\u2000C. Gas chromatography-mass\nspectroscopy analysis was performed using a Pegasus 4D timeof-\nflight mass spectrometer (LECO, Saint Joseph MI) equipped\nwith a MPS2 autosampler (Gerstel, Linthicum, MD) and a 7890A\noven (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States).\nThe derivatization products were separated on a 30-m, 0.25 mm\ni.d., 0.25 mm df Rxi-5Sil column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA,\nUnited States) with an IntegraGuard precolumn using ultrapure\nHe at a constant flow of 0.9 ml min\U001000001 as carrier gas. The linear\nthermal gradient started with a 1-min hold at 70\u2000C, followed\nby a ramp to 300\u2000C at 10\u2000C min\U001000001. The final temperature was\nheld for 5 min prior to returning to initial conditions. Mass\nspectra were collected at 17 spectra s\U001000001. Peak identification was\nconducted using the Fiehn primary metabolite library (Kind\net al., 2009) and an identity score cutoff of 700. Additionally,\nauthentic standards for a number of primary metabolites were\nanalyzed under identical conditions and the data used to compare\nthe chromatographic behavior. Peak alignment and spectrum\ncomparisons were carried out using the Statistical Compare\nfeature of ChromaTOF software (LECO).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 3 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nIsolation of RNA From Bacteria Cultured\nin Root Exudates and RNA-Seq\nThe strains were pregrown overnight at 25\u2000C on 21C-glucose\nagar and then subcultured into 96-well microplates containing\nliquid 21C-glucose medium amended with Brachypodium\nexudates. The liquid medium was prepared by dissolving the\nlyophilized root exudate material in an appropriate volume of\n21C-glucose medium to concentrate root exudates 20-fold. The\ngrowth medium was sterilized by passing it through a 0.22-\nmm membrane filter. The control cultures were grown under\nidentical conditions in the absence of exudates. All treatments\nwere inoculated at OD600 of 0.1 and incubated for 20 to\n22 h until cultures entered late-exponential growth phase at\n25\u2000C in an atmosphere of 15% oxygen [created by a ProOx\nP110 oxygen controller (BioSpherix, Parish, NY, United States)\nwith a hypoxia C-chamber]. The cells were stabilized by the\naddition RNAprotect reagent (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD,\nUnited States) and total RNA was purified using a RNeasy Protect\nBacteria Mini Kit (QIAGEN) from three biological replicates of\neach strain cultured under control conditions and in exudates.\nThe quality assessment of the extracted RNA samples was\nperformed with a NanoDrop OneC Spectrophotometer (Thermo\nFisher Scientific) and a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies)\nand revealed A260/A280 and A260/A230 values of > 2.0 and a mean\nRNA integrity numbers (RIN) value of > 9.2.\nThree biological replicates of RNA samples were shipped on\ndry ice to the DOE Joint Genome Institute (Walnut Creek, CA,\nUnited States), where rRNA was depleted and stranded RNASeq\nlibraries were prepared, quantified by qPCR and sequenced\nusing a HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina). The fastq file reads\nwere filtered and processed with BBDuk1 to remove reads that\ncontained 1 or more “N” bases, had an average quality score\nacross the read less than 10 or had a minimum length < 51 bp\nor 33% of the full read length. Reads mapped with BBMap (see\ntext footnote 2) to masked human, cat, dog, and mouse references\nat 93% identity were removed. Another category of removed\nsequences matched RNA spike-in, PhiX, common microbial\ncontaminants, and ribosomal RNAs. The processed reads from\neach library were aligned to the reference genome using BBMap\nwith only unique mappings allowed (BAMs/directory). If a\nread mapped to more than one location it was ignored.\nfeatureCounts (Liao et al., 2014) was used to generate raw\ngene counts, which were normalized to adjust for the length of\neach gene and total number of reads mapped for each library.\nThe normalization formula used: n = [r/(l/1,000)]/(t/1,000,000),\nwhere n = normalized read count for gene (G) for library (L);\nr = raw read count for gene G for library L; l = gene G length; and\nt = total reads mapped for library L. Raw gene counts were used to\nevaluate the level of correlation between biological samples using\nPearson’s correlation.\nBioinformatic Analysis\nCount tables generated by the JGI RNA-Seq pipeline were input\ninto DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) to normalize and determine\n1https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/\ndifferential expression. Statistical significance was established\nthrough DESeq2 by using three biological replicates for control\nand root exudate conditions. Scatterplots were generated from\nthe DESeq2 data table outputs using ggplot2. Genes differentially\nexpressed between control and root exudate samples (log2 foldchanges\n–2 \u2000 to \u2000 2, adjusted p value \u2000 0.05) were used in\ndownstream analysis. The core genome and pangenome for the\nPseudomonas strains used in this study were computed using the\nOthoMCL v.2.0, Species Tree Builder v.2.2.0, and Phylogenetic\nPangenome Accumulation v1.4.0 apps implemented in the U.S.\nDepartment of Energy Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase)\n(Arkin et al., 2018). Additional comparisons were conducted\nwith the PGAweb pangenome analysis pipeline (Chen et al.,\n2018). Differentially expressed genes were assigned to core,\nnon-core, and singleton parts of each strain’s proteome by\nBLASTp with an E value cutoff of e-06, identity of 40%\nand coverage of 60%. Functional annotation of differentially\nexpressed genes was carried out with the Blast2GO (Conesa\nand Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al.,\n2018). Additional manual curation was performed using tools\nimplemented in the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG)\ndatabase (Markowitz et al., 2012), Pseudomonas Genome\nDatabase (Winsor et al., 2009), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and\nGenomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa et al., 2008), and Geneious 10.2.3\n(Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand). Metabolic functions\nencoded by the differentially expressed genes were mapped\nusing iPath 3.0 (Darzi et al., 2018). Phylogenetic analyses\nwere carried out by building multiple sequence alignments\nwith MAFFT v7.222 (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and inferring\nneighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenies with Geneious Tree Builder.\nThe resultant phylogenetic trees were visualized with iTOL\n(Letunic and Bork, 2016). Reproducibility of clades within the\ninferred NJ trees was assessed by bootstrap resampling with\n1,000 replicates.\nCharacterization of Carbon Source\nUtilization With Biolog Phenotype\nMicroarrays\nThe utilization of carbon sources was analyzed using Phenotype\nMicroArrays (Biolog, Hayward, CA, United States) as follows.\nThe bacteria were cultured overnight on Luria-Bertani agar\nat 25\u2000C, after which cells were harvested and suspended in\ninoculating fluid (IF-0). The transmittance of the suspension\nwas adjusted to 42% using a Biolog turbidimeter. The cell\nsuspension was mixed with IF\U001000000 containing Dye Mix A\n(Biolog) to achieve a final transmittance of 85%. One hundred\nmicroliter aliquots of the adjusted cell suspension were\ninoculated into PM01 and PM02A plates, which were then\nincubated in an OmniLog Phenotype MicroArray System\n(Biolog) at 25\u2000C for 48 h. The formation of formazan was\nrecorded at 15 min intervals, and data were analyzed using\nOmniLog Parametric Analysis software v1.20.02 (Biolog).\nRelative growth of the studied strains was normalized to\ngrowth on D-glucose and visualized using Heatmapper\n(Babicki et al., 2016).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 4 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nData Availability\nSequences generated in this project were deposited\nunder NCBI BioProject accession numbers PRJNA439743\nthrough PRJNA439790.\nRESULTS\nMetabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates\nof B. distachyon\nMetabolomics analysis of lyophilized root exudates revealed\nthe presence of numerous plant metabolites, 86 of which were\nidentified by matching their spectra to the LECO/Fiehn\nMetabolomics library (Supplementary Table 3). These\nmetabolites included (i) carbohydrates and their derivatives\n(glucose, fructose, xylose, sucrose, trehalose, maltose, galactose,\nand others); (ii) sugar alcohols (b-mannosylglycerate, myoinositol,\ngalactinol, 2-deoxyerythritol, ribitol, threitol and\ncellobitol); (iii) amino acids and derivatives (glutamine,\ntyrosine, glutamic acid, asparagine, aspartic acid, valine,\nphenylalanine, isoleucine, glycine, serine, proline, leucine,\ntryptophan, cysteine, methionine, citrulline, and others); (iv)\norganic acids (aconitic, allantoic, g-aminobutyric, azelaic, citric,\nfumaric, 2-furoic, D-glyceric, 3-hydroxypropionic, a-ketoadipic,\nmalic, methylmalonic, nicotinic, quinic, succinic, threonic);\nand (v) assorted metabolites including heterocyclic compounds,\nphenolics, and biogenic amines, etc (3-hydroxypyridine,\nmaleimide, noradrenaline, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoate,\n5-methoxytryptamine, uracil, aminomalonic acid, palmitic acid,\nand urea). Results of the analysis also revealed that root exudates\nof B. distachyon contain hydroxyectoine and the quaternary\namine (QA) glycine betaine (Supplementary Figure 1).\nPhylogenetic and Pangenome Analyses\nof Pseudomonas Strains Used in the\nStudy\nWe used a set of phylogenetic markers suggested by Mulet et al.\n(2010) to investigate the relatedness of the eight strains used in\nthis study to distinct lineages recognized within the P. fluorescens\nspecies complex. The multilocus sequence analysis based on\nthe concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S\nrRNA), gyrB, rpoB, and rpoD identified R1-43-08 (along with\nstrains 2-79 and SBW25) as a member of the P. fluorescens\nsubgroup (Figure 1). The rest of the strains clustered closely with\nfour additional subgroups of the P. fluorescens complex, namely\nP. corrugata (strains Q2-87 and Q8r1-96), P. koreensis (Pf0-1),\nP. protegens (Pf-5), and P. chlororaphis (30–84). The genomes of\nthe eight rhizosphere Pseudomonas strains varied in size by 1.43\nmegabase (ranging from 5.65 to 7.07 Mb) and contained between\n5,166 and 6,363 protein-coding genes (Figure 2A). The shared\ngene content was characterized with OrthoMCL, which uses allagainst-\nall BLASTp followed by the Markov Cluster algorithm to\nidentify protein groups shared between the compared genomes,\nas well as groups representing species-specific gene expansion\nfamilies (Li et al., 2003). The pangenome analysis revealed a\ncore comprised of approximately 3,179 orthologs that were\nshared among all strains and represented 50.0% to 61.5%\nof each predicted proteome (Figures 2A,B). The non-core\npangenome contained genes shared by two or more (but not\nall) strains and contained between 1,482 and 2,080 orthologs,\nwhich corresponded to 28.7–36.3% of individual proteomes. The\nrest of the predicted protein-coding genes were strain-specific\nsingletons that comprised 7.5% to 15.1% of the strain’s predicted\nproteomes. In respect to divergence from the core genome, strain\nPf-5 was found to possess the highest proportion of unique genes\n(n = 949) followed by 2-79 (n = 887). The entire pangenome of\nthe Pseudomonas strains encompassed over 12,000 homolog and\nsingleton gene families.\nFurther homolog family-based comparisons identified Q8r1-\n96 and R1-43-08 as the most distantly related strains, with\n3349 shared homologs (Supplementary Table 4A). Q8r1-96 and\nQ2-87, which shared 4,489 homologs, were the most closely\nrelated strains. The partitioning of homolog gene families into\nthe core, non-core, and singleton parts of the pangenome agreed\nwith phylogenetic relationships of the strains deduced from the\nanalysis of a selected subset of COGs (Clusters of Orthologous\nGroups) (Figure 2C and Supplementary Tables 4B,C). The\nCOG-based phylogeny supported the multilocus sequence\nanalysis and revealed that the eight Pseudomonas strains form\nthree distinct clusters, the first of which contained 2-79, R1-30-\n84, and SBW25. The second cluster included Q8r1-96 and Q2-87,\nwhereas the third encompassed strains 30-84, Pf-5, and Pf0-1.\nCorrelating the Composition of Root\nExudates With Metabolic Profiles of\nPseudomonas Strains\nWe used the Phenotype MicroArray PM1 and PM2 plates to\nprofile the eight Pseudomonas strains for the utilization of\n190 different carbon sources. Results of the analysis identified\n90 compounds that supported growth and clustered by their\nintensities of utilization into three distinct groups (Figure 3).\nGroup I was comprised of 30 highly metabolized carbon\nsources, which included several amino acids and intermediates of\nglycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, and citrate cycle. Approximately\nhalf of these compounds were catabolized by all eight strains,\nand included several organic acids (fumaric, citric, gluconic,\nmalic, and pyroglutamic), amino acids (Glu, Asn, Gln, Asp, Pro,\nAla, and g-aminobutyric acid), carbohydrates (glucose, mannose,\nand mannitol), and the purine nucleoside inosine. Group II\nwas composed of 44 chemically diverse carbon sources that\nwere variably utilized by the strains. These compounds were\ncarbohydrates, organic acids, amino acids, phenolics, and polyols,\nand included known compatible solutes and intermediates of\nmetabolism of pentoses, galactose, starch, and sucrose. Group\nIII encompassed the rest of the Phenotype MicroArray test\npanel and contained compounds that were not catabolized\nby the tested strains. Among several notable exceptions were\na-hydroxyglutamic acid- g-lactone, putrescine, and itaconic,\ncitramalic, and succinamic acids, which supported the growth\nof strains 2-79, 30-84, Pf-5, and SBW25.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nFIGURE 1 | Neighbor joining phylogeny showing the relationship of the eight strains used in this study (indicated by red triangles) to different species of the\nP. fluorescens complex. The phylogeny was established based on the concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S rRNA), gyrB (subunit B of DNA\ngyrase), rpoB (b subunit of RNA polymerase), and rpoD (sigma 70 factor subunit of RNA polymerase). Distance matrices were calculated by the Jukes-Cantor\nmethod. Colored circles on tree nodes indicate bootstrap values (1,000 replicates) that vary between 60% (smallest circle) and 100% (largest circles).\nB. distachyon Bd21. Interestingly, many carbon sources from\nthe Phenotype MicroArray panel were also present in the root\nexudates of B. distachyon Bd21, and some of these compounds\n(glucose, mannose, galactose, fructose, g-aminobutyric acid,\naspartic acid, citric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, quinic acid,\nalanine, glutamine, and glutamic acid) were catabolized by all\nstrains used in this study, while others (e.g., xylose, trehalose,\nm-inositol) were actively utilized only by certain organisms\n(Figure 3). The comparison of catabolic profiles across the\neight studied Pseudomonas strains revealed the presence of three\ndistinct clusters. The first cluster contained strains Q8r1-96 and\nQ2-87, which consumed very similar sets of carbon sources,\nas well as strain Pf0-1. The second cluster was composed of\n2-79, R1-43-08, SBW25, and 30-84, whereas the third cluster\nwas represented by a single strain, Pf-5. The overall similarity\nof the catabolic profiles partially agreed with the separation\nof the strains into different subgroups of the P. fluorescens\ncomplex (see above).\nAnalysis of the RNA-seq Results\nIn order to understand the cellular responses of rhizosphere\nPseudomonas to plant exometabolites, we analyzed the\ntranscriptome changes in cultures grown in the presence of\nroot exudates. Under field conditions, rhizobacteria colonize\nplant roots in the form of surface-attached microaerobic biofilms\n(Hojberg et al., 1999). To mimic these conditions, the eight\nPseudomonas strains were grown statically at 72% air saturation\nin 21C-glucose medium amended with root exudates and then\nprocessed to extract total RNA (Supplementary Figure 2).\nA total of 995 million raw sequencing reads were generated from\nthe RNA samples by using the Illumina HiSeq-2500 platform,\naveraging 20.7 million reads per sample. The removal of lowquality\nand rRNA sequences resulted in a total of 793 million\nfiltered reads that were mapped onto the eight Pseudomonas\ngenomes with a mean of 7.48 million mapped fragments per\ngenome. The differentially abundant transcripts were identified\nby setting a p value of 0.05 (adjusted for multiple testing) and\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 6 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

(B) The gradual expansion of\nthe pangenome (blue color) and contraction of the core genome (green color) following the sequential addition of genomes from the dataset. Box plots indicate the\n25th and 75th percentiles and medians (horizontal lines) with whiskers corresponding to the 10th and 90th percentiles. The input order was randomized to avoid any\nbias due to the sequential addition of new genomes. The pangenome size increases steadily without reaching a plateau even after the addition of 11,939\nnon-redundant gene families. At the same time, the core genome converged to 3,179 genes. (C) The pangenome-based phylogenomic analysis of the studied\nstrains. Here, the pangenome was defined with OrthoMCL, and orthologous gene sets were then partitioned into the core, singleton, and non-core (the remaining\northolog sets) categories. These categories were calculated for each node in the Maximum Likelihood species tree, using the set of genomes for which that node\nrepresents the ancestor. The results of the ortholog partitioning are shown in pie charts placed at tree nodes. Numbers indicate bootstrap support values. The\nanalysis was conducted in KBase (Arkin et al., 2018).\nthe log2 fold-change (FC) threshold \u2000\u2000 2.0 (Figure 4 and\nSupplementary Tables 5–12). When compared with the control\nconditions, an average of 204 genes per strain were differentially\nexpressed in the presence of root exudates, with the highest\n(n = 425) and lowest (n = 112) numbers observed, respectively,\nin SBW25 and Q2-87 (Figure 4). Overall, more genes were\ninduced than repressed in response to exudates, but the actual\nnumbers in each category varied substantially depending on the\nidentity of the Pseudomonas strain. In most strains, the bulk of\nthe differentially expressed genes was almost equally distributed\nbetween the core (mean, 48.2%) and non-core (mean, 45.8%)\nparts of the genome, whereas the strain-specific singleton genes\nconstituted on average only 5.9% (Figure 4B). One notable\nexception was observed in Q8r1-96, where all differentially\nexpressed genes belonged to the core (73.8%) and non-core\n(26.2%) parts of the genome. Another notable pattern was\nobserved in R1-43-08, where the majority of genes affected by\nthe presence of root exudate fell into the non-core category\n(56.3%). The highest proportion of differentially expressed\nsingletons (11.3 and 10.4%, respectively) was identified in\nstrains SBW25 and Pf-5.\nWe further explored how the identified differentially\nexpressed genes were distributed across genomes of the eight\nstudied rhizosphere strains. The pairwise BLASTp comparisons\nidentified 2-79 and SBW25 as two strains that shared the highest\nnumber of genes (n = 101) induced or repressed in response\nto root exudates (Table 1). The second pair of strains with\na significant number of similar differentially expressed genes\n(n = 86) was Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, which was followed by Pf0-1\nand 30-84, which shared 56 differentially expressed genes. These\npatterns of shared genes were also observed when the results of\nthe pairwise BLASTp comparisons were converted into a binary\ngene presence/absence matrix, which was then subjected to\ncluster analysis using a UPGMA algorithm based on Sorensen’s\ndissimilarity index or examined by non-metric multidimensional\nscaling (NMDS) (Figure 5).\nThe differentially expressed Pseudomonas genes were\nsubjected to Blast2Go analysis and Gene Ontology (GO)\nannotation (Figure 6). Metabolic process, catalytic activity,\nand membrane were the most common annotation terms\nacross the three primary GO term categories (i.e., biological\nprocess, molecular function, and cellular component). A total\nof 1,694 GO terms was assigned to 805 upregulated genes, with\nthe majority of the GO terms related to molecular function\n(682, 40.3%), followed by biological process (669, 39.5%), and\ncellular component (343, 20.2%). In the 539 downregulated gene\ncategory, 1,101 GO terms were assigned to biological process\n(420, 38.1%), molecular function (417, 37.9%), and cellular\ncomponent (264, 24.0%). Within biological process, metabolic\nprocess, cellular process, localization, response to stimulus, and\nregulation were over-represented. Within molecular function,\nthe largest proportion was assigned to catalytic activity, binding,\nand transporter activity categories. Within cellular component,\nthe majority were assigned to membrane, membrane part, cell,\nand cell part categories. Across the eight strains, 37–42% of\ndifferentially expressed genes had no Gene Ontology IDs and\nencoded various conserved hypothetical proteins.\nFunctional Classification of Shared\nDifferentially Expressed Genes\nThe interrogation of RNA-seq data revealed multiple cellular\npathways that were differentially regulated in bacterial cultures\nincubated with root exudates (Supplementary Figures 3, 4).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 7 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nFIGURE 3 | Biolog Phenotype MicroArray profiling the eight rhizosphere\nPseudomonas strains used in the study. The hierarchical clustering analysis\nwas carried out using the average linkage method with Euclidean distances.\nCarbon sources identified by red arrowheads were also detected in the sterile\nroot exudates of B. distachyon Bd21.\nAlthough none of these differentially regulated pathways were\nshared by all eight strains, the cross-strain comparisons revealed\nseveral types of common and specific transcriptomic responses\nthat were elicited by the presence of plant exometabolites\n(Table 2). The visual representation of core gene expression\npatterns is provided in Supplementary Figure 5, which\nshows heatmaps of expression profiles and p-adj values for\ncore genes shared by the studied strains. The figure is\naccompanied by Supplementary Table 13 that lists predicted\nfunctions of genes constituting the four distinct clusters\nobserved after hierarchical clustering of gene expression\nvalues. The first category of shared differentially expressed\npathways functioned in the uptake and catabolism of selected\ncarbohydrates, quaternary ammonium compounds (QAs), and\nphenolics. All strains except for R1-43-08, responded to root\nexudates by inducing the fructose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate\n(PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTSFru). The\ncomponents of this system are encoded by a conserved\noperon and include the cytoplasmic polyprotein EI/HPr/EIIAFru\n(FruB), the 1-phosphofructokinase FruK, and the fructosespecific\npermease EIIBC (FruA) (Chavarria et al., 2016). The\nPTSFru system functions by acquiring high-energy phosphates\nfrom PEP and sequentially passing them, via the EI/HPr/EIIAFru\ndomains of FruB, to the EIIB component of FruA. The\nphosphates are ultimately transferred by the EIIC transporter\nto fructose yielding fructose 1-phosphate, which is channeled\ninto the central metabolic pathways through the action of the\nphosphofructokinase FruK.\nIn all strains except for Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, the exposure to root\nexudates resulted in the induction of two genes adjacent to the\nfru cluster that encoded a Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS)\ntransporter and an L-arabinonate dehydratase (Table 2). These\ngenes are predicted to participate in the uptake and catabolism\nof L-arabinose, where L-arabinonate dehydratase plays an\nimportant role by converting L-arabinonate to 2-dehydro-3-\ndeoxy-L-arabinonate (Rahman et al., 2017). In SBW25, R1-\n43-08, and Q2-87, we also observed the induction of genes\nencoding components of the AraFGH complex, an ATP-Binding\nCassette (ABC) superfamily transporter involved in the import of\narabinose into the cell (Supplementary Tables 6, 7, 9). Finally, all\nstrains except SBW25 and R1-43-08 responded to the presence\nof exudates by upregulating a conserved gene encoding an\naldose epimerase superfamily protein. Such enzymes equilibrate\nalpha- and beta-anomers of aldoses and ensure that stereospecific\nenzymes involved in the metabolism of free sugars do not act as\nmetabolic bottlenecks (Abayakoon et al., 2018). Although some\naldose epimerases have been linked to specific pathways, the\nPseudomonas gene identified in this study could not be assigned\nto a particular metabolic process based on sequence analysis and\ngenomic location.\nSeveral Pseudomonas strains responded to the presence\nof root exudates by upregulating genes involved in the\nuptake and catabolism of myo-inositol and possibly other\nstereoisomers of inositol (Table 2). The upregulated catabolic\ngenes encode the dehydrogenase IolG, which oxidizes myoinositol\nto its corresponding ketone, as well as IolE, IolD, IolB,\nand IolC that collectively convert the 2-keto-myo-inositol to\nacetyl-CoA and the glycolysis intermediate dihydroxyacetone\nphosphate (Yoshida et al., 2008; Kohler et al., 2011).

The cross-genome comparisons revealed\nthat in all studied strains except for Pf0-1, components\nof the myo-inositol utilization pathway were encoded\nwithin a well-conserved gene cluster which, in addition to\ncatabolic and transport functions, also encodes a dedicated\ntranscriptional repressor.\nAll studied strains of Pseudomonas carry multiple genes\ninvolved in scavenging the quaternary ammonium compounds\ncholine, glycine betaine (GB), carnitine, choline-O-sulfate, and\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 9 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

Many of these genes were\ndifferentially expressed, including those encoding parts of the\nABC transporter CbcXWV, which is predicted to function in\nthe uptake of choline under water-replete conditions (Table 2).\nAmong enzymes induced in the presence of root exudates were\nthe choline dehydrogenase BetA, which converts choline to\nglycine betaine and a network of enzymes (i.e., the Rieske family\noxygenase GbcAB, the dimethyglycine demethylase DgcAB, and\nthe sarcosine oxidase SoxBDAG) that sequentially convert GB\nto glycine. In 2-79 and SBW25, this group of differentially\nregulated genes also included an AraC-family transcriptional\nactivator GbdR, which perceives intercellular levels of GB and\ninduces genes involved in the transport and catabolism of\nglycine betaine and detoxification of the catabolic byproducts\n(Hampel et al., 2014).\nThe last category of activated catabolic pathways included the\ncatechol branch of the b-ketoadipate pathway for the degradation\nof aromatic compounds. In strains 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5,\ngrowth on root exudates resulted in upregulation of catechol-\n1,2-dioxygenase, muconate cycloisomerase, and muconolactone\nisomerase, which collectively cleave the catechol ring and\nconvert it to b-ketoadipate enol-lactone (Harwood and Parales,\n1996). Finally, analysis of the P. synxantha 2-79 transcriptome\nidentified an induction of benABC genes encoding subunits\nof benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase, an oxidoreductase that generates\ncatechol from benzoate.\nIn addition to various catabolic pathways, the exposure to root\nexudates also induced several genes involved in the homeostasis\nof copper (Table 2). Four of these genes form a conserved cluster\nin genomes of the strains and encode the periplasmic coppersensing\ntwo-component system CinRS, the plastocyanin/azurinlike\nprotein CinA, and the NADPH-dependent pre-Q0 reductase\nCinQ. Also, in strains Q2-87, 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, we observed\nupregulation of a conserved operon encoding the multicopper\noxidase CopA, the periplasmic copper-binding protein CopC, the\ninner membrane protein CopD, and outer membrane protein\nCopB. In several Gram-negative bacteria, these Cop proteins are\nthought to have dual functions and participate both in the uptake\nof essential copper as well as in the sequestration of excess copper\nin the periplasm and outer membrane.\nThe analysis of shared downregulated pathways revealed that\nmost of the strains respond to the presence of root exudates by\nrepressing genes involved in the uptake and catabolism of sulfur\ncompounds (Table 2). In strains SBW25, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96,\nQ2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, this response involved the ssuEADCB\noperon responsible for the utilization of alkanesulfonates\nas sulfur sources. The ssu operon is highly conserved in\nfluorescent pseudomonads and encodes the FMNH2-dependent\nmonooxygenase SsuD and the NAD (P)H-dependent FMN\nreductase SsuE, which together catalyze the desulfonation of\nalkanesulfonates. Also, the ssu locus contains genes for the\nmolybdopterin-binding protein SsuF and the alkanesulfonatespecific\nABC-type transporter consisting of the sulfonate\nsubstrate-binding protein SsuA, sulfonate permease protein\nSsuC, and sulfonate transport ATP-binding protein SsuB. Finally,\nin R1-43-08, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, growth on root exudates\ncoincided with repression of the tauABCD operon, which\nallows these strains to utilize taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonate)\nas a sulfur source. The repressed tau genes encoded the\n2-oxoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenase TauD and\nsubstrate-binding, ATP-binding, and permease components of\nthe taurine-specific ABC transporter TauABC.\nOther Differentially Expressed Pathways\nIn addition to their effect on several shared cellular pathways,\ngrowth on root exudates resulted in the induction or repression of\nnumerous strain-specific genes. In closely related P. synxantha 2-\n79 and P. fluorescens SBW25, we observed differential expression\nof genes involved in energy metabolism, transport of amino\nacids, and surface attachment (Supplementary Tables 5, 6).\nOther notable differentially expressed pathways included 2–\n79 gene clusters that encode enzymes for the catabolism of\ntrehalose, a prophage, and toxin/antitoxin system, as well as the\nSBW25 operon predicted to control the synthesis of the capsular\nexopolysaccharide colonic acid. The response of Pseudomonas sp.\nR1-43-08 to root exudates also involved differential expression\nof different energy metabolism pathways. In addition, we\nobserved the upregulation of genes involved in the uptake and\ncatabolism of xylose (also upregulated in 2–79) and repression\nof enzymes for the biosynthesis of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid\nand assimilation of inorganic sulfur and L-cysteine biosynthesis\n(Supplementary Table 7).\nThe analysis of the Q8r1-96 transcriptome revealed\nperturbation of different metabolic pathways including genes\nencoding components of cytochrome C oxidase, transport\nand catabolism of sorbitol/mannitol, metabolism of butanoic\nacid, and biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides alginate and\npoly-b-1-6-N-acetylglucosamine (Supplementary Table 8). In\nP. fluorescens Q2-87, we identified differential expression of\ngenes involved in metabolism of galactose, tryptophan, tyrosine,\nglycine, serine, and threonine (Supplementary Table 9),\nwhile in P. chlororaphis 30-84, growth on exudates activated\nthe biosynthesis of molybdopterin cofactor, catabolism of\ngalactonate and acetoin, and uptake and catabolism of putrescine\n(Supplementary Table 10). The response of P. protegens Pf-5 to\nroot exudates involved upregulation of acetoin dehydrogenase,\nwhich converts acetoin to acetaldehyde and acetyl-CoA, as\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 10 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

The terms were derived from 93 different functional groups (GO subcategories level 4). The GO terms were assigned with Blast2GO (Conesa\nand Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al., 2018). On a WEGO histogram, the percentage of 100 is defined as the total number of genes assigned a GO\nterm. However, the subcategories do not add up to 100% because many genes fall into more than one functional class and are therefore annotated by multiple GO\nterms.\nwell as pathways for the utilization of glycolate and putrescine\n(Supplementary Table 11). Also induced were genes for\nthe production of pyrrolnitrin and PhlG hydrolase, which\nmodulate the metabolic loads attributed to the synthesis of\n2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol. The differentially expressed genes of\nP. fluorescens Pf0-1 included, among others, operons encoding\ncytochrome C oxidase and enzymes for catabolism of malonic\nacid (Supplementary Table 12). Yet another interesting\nfinding involved the induction of assorted genes acting in the\nhomeostasis of iron and defense against reactive oxygen species\n(ROS). We observed activation of iron dicitrate transporters\n(SBW25 and 30-84), genes for the biosynthesis of siderophores\nornicorrugatin (SBW25) and pyochelin (Pf-5), heme-degrading\nenzymes (2–79, 30–84), TonB siderophore receptors, and\ncomponents of the energy-transducing inner membrane\ncomplex TonB-ExbB-ExbD (2–79 and Pf-5). The differentially\nexpressed ROS defense pathways were represented by different\ncatalases in strains 2–79, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and\nPf-5 and organic hydroperoxide resistance proteins in strains\nSBW25 and R1-43-08.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nsoil microorganisms. Our results were in agreement with a\nrecent report of 27 different sugars, amino acids, and organic\nacids in Brachypodium exudates (Kawasaki et al., 2016). We\nconfirmed the presence of exometabolites identified in that\nstudy, along with dozens of additional analytes that were\nidentified by matching their mass-spectra and retention indices\nto the LECO/Fiehn Metabolomics library (Supplementary\nTable 3). The complementation of the metabolomic analysis\nwith profiling of the bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays\nrevealed that a substantial proportion of the characterized\nexudate constituents were catabolized by a collection of eight\nPseudomonas strains from across the P. fluorescens group that is\nknown to form associations with plant roots. The amendment\nof Pseudomonas cultures with root exudates caused changes in\nthe expression of multiple genes encoding catabolic and anabolic\nenzymes, predicted transporters, transcriptional regulators, stress\nresponse, and conserved hypothetical proteins. In most strains,\nthese differentially expressed genes were almost equally split\nbetween the core and variable genome regions, mirroring\nthe substantial strain-to-strain variation in the genome size\nand gene content within the P. fluorescens species complex\n(Loper et al., 2012).\nThe analysis of transcriptome responses to root exudates\nrevealed several types of cellular pathways present in the strains\nused in this study. The first category of such pathways was\ninvolved in the catabolism of carbohydrates such as fructose,\narabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, trehalose, and galactose. Among\nthese catabolic traits, the ability to utilize fructose as a carbon\nsource is highly conserved among fluorescent pseudomonads.\nIn contrast, growth on arabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, and\ntrehalose is variably present and was traditionally used to\ndifferentiate species and biovars within the P. fluorescens\ngroup (Barrett et al., 1986). We speculate that such variably\ndistributed pathways contribute to the differential affinity of\npseudomonads toward host plants and/or to determine which\nstrains flourish in response to growing roots and changing\nenvironments. Several independent studies have confirmed\nthe importance of carbohydrate catabolism pathways for the\nbiology of rhizosphere pseudomonads. For example, in vivo\nexpression technology (IVET) profiling of P. fluorescens SBW25\nidentified xylose isomerase among genome regions essential\nfor the colonization of sugar beet seedlings (Liu et al., 2015),\nwhereas a genome-wide Tn-Seq screen of Pseudomonas simiae\nidentified genes for the catabolism of myo-inositol among traits\nessential for the colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana roots\n(Cole et al., 2017).\nThe response of rhizosphere Pseudomonas to Brachypodium\nroot exudates also involved pathways for the uptake and\nmetabolism of amino acids. We observed differential\nexpression of genes encoding the hydrophobic (HAAT) and\npolar (PAAT) amino acid uptake transporters in strains\n2-79, SBW25, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5. Other related genes\nencoded enzymes for the catabolism of valine and glutamic\nacid (2-79); metabolism of tryptophan, glycine, serine, and\nthreonine (Q2-87); and biosynthesis of methionine (Q8r1-\n96). It is plausible that the abundance of amino acids in\nroot exudates is also linked to the repression of pathways\ninvolved in the catabolism of sulfonates and taurine that\nwas observed in several strains (Table 2). Although the\npreferred source of sulfur for P. fluorescens is unknown, in the\nclosely related P. aeruginosa, the sulfur starvation response\nis triggered by the growth on any sulfur compound other\nthan sulfate, thiocyanate, and cysteine (Hummerjohann et al.,\n1998). This fact, together with the presence of cysteine and\ncystine in the root exudates, suggest that root exudates of\nBrachypodium may serve as an important source of sulfur for\nrhizosphere Pseudomonas. These findings also agree well with\nthe reported scarcity of inorganic sulfate in the soil, and the\npresence of sulfur mostly in the form of organic compounds,\nincluding amino acids, proteins, sulfate esters, and sulfonates\n(Autry and Fitzgerald, 1990).\nAnother interesting result of this study was the concerted\nactivation of copper and iron homeostasis pathways observed\nin all of the Pseudomonas strains used in this work. In bacteria,\nan excess of copper is toxic and triggers oxidative stress due to\nthe formation of free radicals, as well as disruption of protein\nmetalation and stability of iron-sulfur clusters (Bondarczuk\nand Piotrowska-Seget, 2013). On the other hand, copper is an\nessential trace element used as a cofactor in different enzymes.\nSimilarly, although elevated levels of iron cause redox stress, this\nelement is also found in active energy metabolism enzymes and is\ncrucial for bacterial growth (Andrews et al., 2003). The analysis\nof metal homeostasis genes identified in this study suggests\nthat their induction was likely triggered by the deficiency of\ncopper and iron in bacterial cultures grown in the presence of\nroot exudates. We attribute this effect to the ability of some\ncomponents of root exudates to chelate soil metals.\nDespite the abundance of iron in the soil, its bioavailability\nis limited due to the low solubility of Fe (III) oxyhydrates\nat neutral pH. The non-graminaceous plants circumvent this\nproblem by acidifying the rhizosphere and secreting flavins,\nphenolics, and organic acids that chelate iron. The reduction\nof these ferric chelates releases soluble ferrous iron taken up\nby root cells (Kobayashi and Nishizawa, 2012). Graminaceous\nplants, like Brachypodium, acquire iron by secreting into the\nsoil non-protein amino acids of the mugineic acid (MA) group,\nwhich act as Fe (III)-chelating phytosiderophores. In addition to\niron, low-molecular-weight organic acids and phytosiderophores\nbind other divalent and trivalent metals (including copper) and\ncontribute to heavy-metal tolerance in plants (Chen et al., 2017).\nIt is plausible that the presence of these plant exometabolites\nis responsible for the deficit of iron and copper observed in\nPseudomonas cultures grown in the presence of root exudates.\nThese results further underscore the importance of diverse and\nredundant metal homeostasis pathways found in genomes of the\nP. fluorescens group for the ability of these organisms to colonize\nand persist in the plant rhizosphere.\nRecently, Klonowska et al. (2018) examined transcriptomic\nresponses of symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria to root\nexudates of the legume plant Mimosa pundica, which has\nan unusual ability to support both alpha- (Rhizobium) and\nbeta-rhizobia (Cupriavidus and Burkholderia). Using RNA-seq,\nthe authors characterized genes involved in the perception of\nroot exudates in the nodulating bacteria Burkholderia phymatum\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 14 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nSTM815, Cupriavidus taiwanensis LMG19424, and Rhizobium\nmesoamericanum STM3625. Interestingly, the analysis of\ndifferentially expressed genes revealed induction of pathways\ninvolved in the catabolism of fructose, xylose, myo-inositol,\nand protocatechuate/catechol. Also upregulated were some\ncopper homeostasis, siderophore biosynthesis, and oxidative\nstress genes. Finally, the analytical profiling of M. pundica\nexudates revealed an overlap with Brachypodium in the types of\ncarbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids present. These\nfindings suggest that differentially expressed genes shared by\nmultiple strains of the group P. fluorescens are not unique to\nthe Brachypodium-Pseudomonas system but represent a set\nof conserved cellular pathways involved in the perception of\nplant exometabolites by different clades of rhizosphere-dwelling\nProteobacteria.\nMost strains included in this study were originally selected\nbased on the ability to colonize the rhizosphere and produce\nsecondary metabolites that alleviate the plant stress response\nand/or inhibit soilborne pathogens. It has been suggested\nthat plant metabolites released into the rhizosphere affect\nthe biocontrol activity of plant-beneficial pseudomonads (de\nWerra et al., 2011). We provide further support to this\nhypothesis by demonstrating that in some strains, root exudates\nmodulate the expression of genes for the catabolism of\nthe plant growth-promoting metabolites acetoin and 2,3-\nbutanediol. The exposure to exudates also affected the expression\nof genes for the synthesis of well-characterized antifungal\ncompounds pyrrolnitrin, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, and 2,4-\ndiacetylphloroglucinol. The modulatory effects were strainspecific,\nsuggesting significant differences in the regulatory\nnetworks involved in the perception of plant signals and\nregulation of the production of antibiotics and growthpromoting\nmetabolites.\nThe final significant finding of this study was the induction\nof catabolism of quaternary amines (QAs) observed in multiple\nstrains of the P. fluorescens group during growth on root\nexudates. This observation was supported by the detection of\nglycine betaine in the root secretions of B. distachyon. The\npresence of QAs in plant tissues and the capacity of these\nmetabolites to provide stress protection and nutrients to plant\npathogens and symbionts were reported before (Boncompagni\net al., 1999; Chen et al., 2013; Kabbadj et al., 2017), but our\nstudy is among the first to highlight the potential importance of\nthese metabolites for rhizosphere interactions. Pseudomonads do\nnot synthesize QAs de novo but have evolved many pathways to\nscavenge them from eukaryotic hosts, where these metabolites\nare abundant due to the prominence of phosphatidylcholine\nin cellular membranes. Strains of P. fluorescens carry genes\nfor the conversion of choline, carnitine, and glycine betaine to\nglycine, as well as quaternary amine transporters of the BCCT\nand ABC families that are also conserved in the opportunistic\nhuman pathogen P. aeruginosa and the plant pathogen P. syringae\n(Galvao et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2013; Wargo, 2013b).\nIn P. aeruginosa, choline catabolism genes are essential for\nthe ability of this pathogen to persist during lung infection\n(Wargo, 2013a). Similarly, a P. syringae mutant deficient in\nBetT, OpuC, and CbcXWV quaternary amine transporters had\nreduced fitness during colonization of bean and soybean leaves\nunder greenhouse and field conditions (Chen et al., 2013).\nDepending on water availability, P. aeruginosa and P. syringae\ncatabolize exogenously supplied QAs as carbon and nitrogen\nsources or accumulate them as osmoprotectants (Chen et al.,\n2013; Wargo, 2013b). Our ongoing work in P. synxantha 2–\n79 unraveled similar physiological responses and demonstrated\nthat QA transporters function differentially and redundantly\nin the uptake of quaternary amines as nutrients (Pablo and\nMavrodi, unpublished). In contrast, under water stress, the QAs\ncholine, betaine, and carnitine are accumulated preferentially for\nosmoprotection. Under drought stress, a 2–79 mutant devoid\nof all known QA transporters was less competitive in the\ncolonization of the Brachypodium rhizosphere than its wild-type\nparental strain. Interestingly, our metabolomic profiling of root\nexudates also revealed proline, glutamine, and hydroxyectoine.\nThese metabolites act as compatible solutes in different groups\nof microorganisms (Yancey et al., 1982; Empadinhas and da\nCosta, 2008), suggesting an important role of root exudates\nin the ability of Pseudomonas to persist in the rhizosphere of\ndrought-stressed plants.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe original contributions presented in the study are publicly\navailable.

Plant roots secrete carbon-rich rhizodeposits containing primary and\nsecondary low molecular weight metabolites, lysates, and mucilages. These exudates\nprovide nutrients for soil microorganisms and modulate their affinity to host plants, but\nmolecular details of this process are largely unresolved. We addressed this gap by\nfocusing on the molecular dialog between eight well-characterized beneficial strains\nof the Pseudomonas fluorescens group and Brachypodium distachyon, a model for\neconomically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops of the grass family. We\ncollected and analyzed root exudates of B. distachyon and demonstrated the presence\nof multiple carbohydrates, amino acids, organic acids, and phenolic compounds. The\nsubsequent screening of bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays revealed that many\nof these metabolites provide carbon and energy for the Pseudomonas strains. RNAseq\nprofiling of bacterial cultures amended with root exudates revealed changes in the\nexpression of genes encoding numerous catabolic and anabolic enzymes, transporters,\ntranscriptional regulators, stress response, and conserved hypothetical proteins. Almost\nhalf of the differentially expressed genes mapped to the variable part of the strains’\npangenome, reflecting the importance of the variable gene content in the adaptation of\nP. fluorescens to the rhizosphere lifestyle. Our results collectively reveal the diversity\nof cellular pathways and physiological responses underlying the establishment of\nmutualistic interactions between these beneficial rhizobacteria and their plant hosts.\nKeywords: Pseudomonas, Brachypodium, rhizosphere, root exudates, transcriptome\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 1 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nINTRODUCTION\nPlants are meta-organisms or holobionts that rely in part on\ntheir microbiome for specific functions and traits. The ability\nof the plant microbiome to influence plant development, vigor,\nhealth, and fitness in response to abiotic stressors associated\nwith global climate change is documented by numerous studies\n(Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009). There is mounting evidence\nthat plants actively recruit beneficial microbiomes, but many\naspects of this process are still very much a black box (Reinhold-\nHurek et al., 2015). The foundation for the differential affinity\nof rhizobacteria toward host plants is built upon complex\nchemical cross talk between microorganisms and plant roots.\nUp to 40% of photosynthetically fixed carbon is released by\nplant roots in the form of exudates and secretions, lysates, and\nmucilages (Curl and Truelove, 1986; Lynch, 1990; Whipps, 1990;\nBadri and Vivanco, 2009). The release of these compounds is\nactively controlled in response to environmental stimuli, and the\ncomposition of root exudates varies greatly according to plant\nspecies and physiological condition (Lynch, 1990; Nguyen, 2003;\nPhillips et al., 2004; De-la-Pena et al., 2008). The presence and\ncomposition of exudates strongly impact soil microorganisms,\nwhich is consistent with the idea that plants actively select and\nshape their root microbiota (Zolla et al., 2013).\nPrimary root exudates include simple and complex sugars,\namino acids, polypeptides and proteins, organic, aliphatic and\nfatty acids, sterols, and phenolics (Nguyen, 2003; Badri and\nVivanco, 2009; Badri et al., 2009). These compounds serve as\ncarbon and energy sources for rhizobacteria, and the presence\nof the intact corresponding catabolic pathways is essential\nfor competitive colonization of roots and disease suppression\n(Lugtenberg et al., 2001; Kamilova et al., 2005; Lugtenberg and\nKamilova, 2009). Root exudates also contain numerous signal\nmolecules and secondary metabolites, the significance of which\nis only now emerging (Walker et al., 2003; Bais et al., 2005,\n2006). A handful of analyses of plant-induced gene expression\nby transcriptional profiling in vitro (Mark et al., 2005) or in\nthe rhizosphere (Silby and Levy, 2004; Ramos-Gonzalez et al.,\n2005; Matilla et al., 2007; Barret et al., 2009) have identified\nmultiple genes that are differentially regulated by exposure to\nroots or root exudates. Bacterial pathways expressed during\nrhizosphere colonization control utilization of plant-derived\nmetabolites (Simons et al., 1996, 1997; Camacho-Carvajal, 2001;\nLugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), motility and chemotaxis (de\nWeert et al., 2002; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), phase\nvariation (Dekkers et al., 1998; Sanchez-Contreras et al., 2002;\nvan den Broek et al., 2005), outer membrane integrity (de Weert\net al., 2006; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), and the ability\nto sequester limiting resources (Raaijmakers et al., 1995) and\nresist environmental stresses (Sarniguet et al., 1995; Miller and\nWood, 1996; van Veen et al., 1997; Schnider-Keel et al., 2001). In\nits spatial and temporal properties, root colonization resembles\nbiofilm formation, and biofilm-related pathways also have been\nimplicated in adhesion to seeds and roots and rhizosphere\ncolonization (Espinosa-Urgel et al., 2000; Hinsa et al., 2003;\nYousef-Coronado et al., 2008; Fuqua, 2010; Martinez-Gil et al.,\n2010; Nielsen et al., 2011; Zboralski and Filion, 2020). Finally,\nroot exudates strongly affect the expression of diverse plant\ngrowth promotion and biocontrol genes (Vacheron et al., 2013).\nOver the past decade, the genomes of numerous rhizosphere\nstrains have been sequenced and analyzed, but functional\ngenomics studies of rhizosphere competence lag behind the\navailability of sequence data.\nThis study explored the molecular dialog between the\nmodel host plant Brachypodium distachyon and several wellcharacterized\nrhizosphere strains of the Pseudomonas fluorescens\ngroup. Brachypodium is a small annual grass originating in semiarid\nregions of the Middle East that has emerged as a prime model\nfor economically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops\nof the grass family (Bevan et al., 2010; Schwartz et al., 2010;\nBrkljacic et al., 2011; Hong et al., 2011; Tyler et al., 2014). The\nbiology, extensive collection of resources, and research tools\nmake B. distachyon an attractive model to investigate interactions\nbetween plants and root-associated microbes. Pseudomonads\nare ubiquitous Gram-negative g-proteobacteria that colonize\neukaryotic hosts and include both commensals and economically\nimportant pathogens of plants and animals (Moore et al.,\n2006; Schroth et al., 2006; Yahr and Parsek, 2006). The genus\nPseudomonas currently comprises > 100 named species that have\nbeen separated based on multilocus sequence analysis into 14\nspecies groups (Garrido-Sanz et al., 2016; Hesse et al., 2018).\nThe P. fluorescens group is the most diverse regarding both\nthe genetic distances within it, the number of species and the\nlarge pangenome that makes up > 50% of the pangenome\nof the genus as a whole (Loper et al., 2012). The group also\nencompasses an unusually high proportion of strains that inhabit\nthe plant rhizosphere and possess plant growth promoting and\nbiocontrol properties. Naylor et al. (2017) profiled bacterial\ncommunities associated with root tissues and rhizosphere of\n18 different plant species of the Poaceae family. That study\nidentified Pseudomonas among taxa constituting the core grass\nroot microbiome and demonstrated that these bacteria were\nenriched in C3 plants, including wheat, rye, barley, oat, and\nBrachypodium. We confirmed the capacity of B. distachyon\nBd21 to serve as a host for rhizobacteria of the P. fluorescens\ngroup in preliminary greenhouse assays with biocontrol strains\nP. synxantha 2-79, P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96, and P. protegens\nPf-5. Results of these experiments revealed that all strains\nsuccessfully established and colonized the roots of Brachypodium\n(Supplementary Table 1).\nIn this study, we focused on eight well-studied strains\nof the P. fluorescens complex that are supported by years\nof studies, numerous refereed publications, and high-quality\ngenome sequences. By profiling transcriptomes of these strains\nduring growth in root exudates of B. distachyon, we revealed the\ndiversity of cellular pathways and physiological responses that\nunderlie the establishment of mutualistic interactions between\nbeneficial rhizobacteria and the host plant. Our results also\nconfirmed that root exudates contain carbohydrates, amino acids,\norganic acids, and phenolics that serve as carbon and energy\nsources for rhizobacteria. The root exudates also contained\nosmoprotectants that may help microorganisms to persist in the\nrhizosphere of drought-stressed plants.

R1-43-08 (Parejko\net al., 2012), P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96 (Raaijmakers and Weller,\n1998), P. fluorescens Q2-87 (Bangera and Thomashow, 1996),\nP. chlororaphis 30-84 (Thomashow et al., 1990), P. fluorescens\nPf0-1 (Silby et al., 2009), and P. protegens Pf-5 (Howell and\nStipanovic, 1980). The selected organisms have been studied\nextensively for their role in biological control and plant\ngrowth promotion (Supplementary Table 2). The strains were\nmaintained in the laboratory as frozen stocks (\U0010000080\u2000C) and\nroutinely cultured in King’s medium B (King et al., 1954) or\n21C medium, which contained (per 1 L): 1.0 g of NH4Cl, 3.5 g\nof Na2HPO4\u20002H2O, 2.8 g of KH2PO4, 3.0 g of glucose, and\n20 ml of a microelement solution (Smibert and Kreig, 1994;\nHalverson and Firestone, 2000).\nPropagation of Plants and Collection of\nRoot Exudates\nB. distachyon Bd21 was established from seed material obtained\nfrom the USDA-ARS Plant Germplasm Introduction and Testing\nResearch Unit (Pullman, WA, United States). Brachypodium\nseeds were imbibed for 3 days at 4\u2000C and sown in 7 \u2000 7 cm\npots filled with Sunshine Potting Mix #4 (Sun Gro Horticulture,\nAgawam, MA, United States). Plants were grown in an IR-\n89X (Percival Scientific, Perry, IA, United States) controlled\nenvironment chamber retrofitted with 6500K and 3000K T5 54W\ngrow lights (Spectralux) under a 20-h light, 24\u2000C/4-h dark, 18\u2000C\ncycle. Plants were watered and fertilized with Jack’s professional\nwater-soluble fertilizer (20:20:20) (JR Peters, Allentown, PA,\nUnited States). After 12 weeks and plant senescence, seeds\nwere collected, processed, and stored under desiccant and dark\nconditions at room temperature.\nTo collect root exudates, seeds of B. distachyon Bd21 were\nsurface-sterilized, pregerminated, and placed in sterile 1 L widemouth\nglass jars containing 113 g of 6-mm glass beads and\n25 ml distilled water. Jars were covered with vented caps\nand plants were grown hydroponically in an environmental\ncontrolled growth chamber under conditions described above.\nAfter 6 days, root exudates were extracted from individual\njars and their sterility was confirmed by spotting on nutrient\nagar. Multiple batches of root exudates were collected, filtered\n(0.22 mm), aliquoted in Falcon tubes (10 ml), lyophilized, and\nstored at –80\u2000C.\nMetabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates\nExudates were analyzed for primary metabolites at the Murdock\nMetabolomics Laboratory at Washington State University\n(Pullman, WA, United States). Freeze-dried residues were\nsuspended in 500 ml 50% aqueous acetonitrile and clarified by\ncentrifugation for 20 min at 21,000 \u2000 g and 4\u2000C. The liquid\nchromatography mass spectrometry analysis was conducted\nwith a Synapt G2-S quadrupole-ion mobility spectrometrytime\nof flight mass spectrometer system equipped with an\nacquity ultra-performance liquid chromatograph (UPLC) and\nan acquity photodiode array detector (all from Waters, Milford,\nMA, United States). The exudate metabolites were separated\non a SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC HPLC column (2.1 \u2000 100 mm,\n3 mm) (Milllipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, United States) using\nacetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid as solvent B and water\nwith 0.1% formic acid as solvent A at a flow rate of 400 ml\nmin\U001000001 and the following linear gradient extending over 14 min:\n0 min, 80% B; 4 min, 80% B, 6 min: 10% B; 7.5 min, 10%\nB; 10 min, 80% B; and 14 min, 80% B. Mass spectra were\ncollected in positive ion mode over a range of m/z 50–1,200\nwith a scan time of 0.2 s. The Q-TOF-MS source was at\n3.0 kV and 120\u2000C; the sampling cone at 40 V, desolvation\ntemperature was 250\u2000C; cone gas and desolvation gas flow were\nat 0 and 850 L h\U001000001, respectively. Leucine enkephalin was used\nfor post-acquisition mass correction. Target compounds were\nvisualized using selected ion chromatograms at 0.05 Da window\nwidth. The compound identification was based on comparison\nof chromatographic behavior and accurate masses to those of\nauthentic standards.\nFor gas chromatography, derivatization was carried out using\na modification of the procedure of Lee and Fiehn (2008).\nThe freeze-dried residues were suspended in 950 ml aqueous\nmethanol (84%, v/v) and clarified by centrifugation for 15 min\nat 21,000 \u2000 g at 4\u2000C. The supernatants were spiked with 1\nmg of the internal standard salicylic acid-d6 (C/D/N Isotopes,\nQuebec, Canada) and dried in vacuo. The dry residues were\nsuspended in 10 ml of O-methoxylamine hydrochloride (30 mg\nml\U001000001 in anhydrous pyridine, both from Millipore Sigma) and\nincubated while mixing (1,000 RPM) for 90 min at 30\u2000C.\nSubsequently, samples were derivatized with 90 ml of MSTFA\nwith 1% TMCS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,\nUnited States) for 30 min at 37\u2000C. Gas chromatography-mass\nspectroscopy analysis was performed using a Pegasus 4D timeof-\nflight mass spectrometer (LECO, Saint Joseph MI) equipped\nwith a MPS2 autosampler (Gerstel, Linthicum, MD) and a 7890A\noven (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States).\nThe derivatization products were separated on a 30-m, 0.25 mm\ni.d., 0.25 mm df Rxi-5Sil column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA,\nUnited States) with an IntegraGuard precolumn using ultrapure\nHe at a constant flow of 0.9 ml min\U001000001 as carrier gas. The linear\nthermal gradient started with a 1-min hold at 70\u2000C, followed\nby a ramp to 300\u2000C at 10\u2000C min\U001000001. The final temperature was\nheld for 5 min prior to returning to initial conditions. Mass\nspectra were collected at 17 spectra s\U001000001. Peak identification was\nconducted using the Fiehn primary metabolite library (Kind\net al., 2009) and an identity score cutoff of 700. Additionally,\nauthentic standards for a number of primary metabolites were\nanalyzed under identical conditions and the data used to compare\nthe chromatographic behavior. Peak alignment and spectrum\ncomparisons were carried out using the Statistical Compare\nfeature of ChromaTOF software (LECO).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 3 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nIsolation of RNA From Bacteria Cultured\nin Root Exudates and RNA-Seq\nThe strains were pregrown overnight at 25\u2000C on 21C-glucose\nagar and then subcultured into 96-well microplates containing\nliquid 21C-glucose medium amended with Brachypodium\nexudates. The liquid medium was prepared by dissolving the\nlyophilized root exudate material in an appropriate volume of\n21C-glucose medium to concentrate root exudates 20-fold. The\ngrowth medium was sterilized by passing it through a 0.22-\nmm membrane filter. The control cultures were grown under\nidentical conditions in the absence of exudates. All treatments\nwere inoculated at OD600 of 0.1 and incubated for 20 to\n22 h until cultures entered late-exponential growth phase at\n25\u2000C in an atmosphere of 15% oxygen [created by a ProOx\nP110 oxygen controller (BioSpherix, Parish, NY, United States)\nwith a hypoxia C-chamber]. The cells were stabilized by the\naddition RNAprotect reagent (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD,\nUnited States) and total RNA was purified using a RNeasy Protect\nBacteria Mini Kit (QIAGEN) from three biological replicates of\neach strain cultured under control conditions and in exudates.\nThe quality assessment of the extracted RNA samples was\nperformed with a NanoDrop OneC Spectrophotometer (Thermo\nFisher Scientific) and a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies)\nand revealed A260/A280 and A260/A230 values of > 2.0 and a mean\nRNA integrity numbers (RIN) value of > 9.2.\nThree biological replicates of RNA samples were shipped on\ndry ice to the DOE Joint Genome Institute (Walnut Creek, CA,\nUnited States), where rRNA was depleted and stranded RNASeq\nlibraries were prepared, quantified by qPCR and sequenced\nusing a HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina). The fastq file reads\nwere filtered and processed with BBDuk1 to remove reads that\ncontained 1 or more “N” bases, had an average quality score\nacross the read less than 10 or had a minimum length < 51 bp\nor 33% of the full read length. Reads mapped with BBMap (see\ntext footnote 2) to masked human, cat, dog, and mouse references\nat 93% identity were removed. Another category of removed\nsequences matched RNA spike-in, PhiX, common microbial\ncontaminants, and ribosomal RNAs. The processed reads from\neach library were aligned to the reference genome using BBMap\nwith only unique mappings allowed (BAMs/directory). If a\nread mapped to more than one location it was ignored.\nfeatureCounts (Liao et al., 2014) was used to generate raw\ngene counts, which were normalized to adjust for the length of\neach gene and total number of reads mapped for each library.\nThe normalization formula used: n = [r/(l/1,000)]/(t/1,000,000),\nwhere n = normalized read count for gene (G) for library (L);\nr = raw read count for gene G for library L; l = gene G length; and\nt = total reads mapped for library L. Raw gene counts were used to\nevaluate the level of correlation between biological samples using\nPearson’s correlation.\nBioinformatic Analysis\nCount tables generated by the JGI RNA-Seq pipeline were input\ninto DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) to normalize and determine\n1https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/\ndifferential expression. Statistical significance was established\nthrough DESeq2 by using three biological replicates for control\nand root exudate conditions. Scatterplots were generated from\nthe DESeq2 data table outputs using ggplot2. Genes differentially\nexpressed between control and root exudate samples (log2 foldchanges\n–2 \u2000 to \u2000 2, adjusted p value \u2000 0.05) were used in\ndownstream analysis. The core genome and pangenome for the\nPseudomonas strains used in this study were computed using the\nOthoMCL v.2.0, Species Tree Builder v.2.2.0, and Phylogenetic\nPangenome Accumulation v1.4.0 apps implemented in the U.S.\nDepartment of Energy Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase)\n(Arkin et al., 2018). Additional comparisons were conducted\nwith the PGAweb pangenome analysis pipeline (Chen et al.,\n2018). Differentially expressed genes were assigned to core,\nnon-core, and singleton parts of each strain’s proteome by\nBLASTp with an E value cutoff of e-06, identity of 40%\nand coverage of 60%. Functional annotation of differentially\nexpressed genes was carried out with the Blast2GO (Conesa\nand Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al.,\n2018). Additional manual curation was performed using tools\nimplemented in the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG)\ndatabase (Markowitz et al., 2012), Pseudomonas Genome\nDatabase (Winsor et al., 2009), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and\nGenomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa et al., 2008), and Geneious 10.2.3\n(Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand). Metabolic functions\nencoded by the differentially expressed genes were mapped\nusing iPath 3.0 (Darzi et al., 2018). Phylogenetic analyses\nwere carried out by building multiple sequence alignments\nwith MAFFT v7.222 (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and inferring\nneighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenies with Geneious Tree Builder.\nThe resultant phylogenetic trees were visualized with iTOL\n(Letunic and Bork, 2016). Reproducibility of clades within the\ninferred NJ trees was assessed by bootstrap resampling with\n1,000 replicates.\nCharacterization of Carbon Source\nUtilization With Biolog Phenotype\nMicroarrays\nThe utilization of carbon sources was analyzed using Phenotype\nMicroArrays (Biolog, Hayward, CA, United States) as follows.\nThe bacteria were cultured overnight on Luria-Bertani agar\nat 25\u2000C, after which cells were harvested and suspended in\ninoculating fluid (IF-0). The transmittance of the suspension\nwas adjusted to 42% using a Biolog turbidimeter. The cell\nsuspension was mixed with IF\U001000000 containing Dye Mix A\n(Biolog) to achieve a final transmittance of 85%. One hundred\nmicroliter aliquots of the adjusted cell suspension were\ninoculated into PM01 and PM02A plates, which were then\nincubated in an OmniLog Phenotype MicroArray System\n(Biolog) at 25\u2000C for 48 h. The formation of formazan was\nrecorded at 15 min intervals, and data were analyzed using\nOmniLog Parametric Analysis software v1.20.02 (Biolog).\nRelative growth of the studied strains was normalized to\ngrowth on D-glucose and visualized using Heatmapper\n(Babicki et al., 2016).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 4 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nData Availability\nSequences generated in this project were deposited\nunder NCBI BioProject accession numbers PRJNA439743\nthrough PRJNA439790.\nRESULTS\nMetabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates\nof B. distachyon\nMetabolomics analysis of lyophilized root exudates revealed\nthe presence of numerous plant metabolites, 86 of which were\nidentified by matching their spectra to the LECO/Fiehn\nMetabolomics library (Supplementary Table 3). These\nmetabolites included (i) carbohydrates and their derivatives\n(glucose, fructose, xylose, sucrose, trehalose, maltose, galactose,\nand others); (ii) sugar alcohols (b-mannosylglycerate, myoinositol,\ngalactinol, 2-deoxyerythritol, ribitol, threitol and\ncellobitol); (iii) amino acids and derivatives (glutamine,\ntyrosine, glutamic acid, asparagine, aspartic acid, valine,\nphenylalanine, isoleucine, glycine, serine, proline, leucine,\ntryptophan, cysteine, methionine, citrulline, and others); (iv)\norganic acids (aconitic, allantoic, g-aminobutyric, azelaic, citric,\nfumaric, 2-furoic, D-glyceric, 3-hydroxypropionic, a-ketoadipic,\nmalic, methylmalonic, nicotinic, quinic, succinic, threonic);\nand (v) assorted metabolites including heterocyclic compounds,\nphenolics, and biogenic amines, etc (3-hydroxypyridine,\nmaleimide, noradrenaline, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoate,\n5-methoxytryptamine, uracil, aminomalonic acid, palmitic acid,\nand urea). Results of the analysis also revealed that root exudates\nof B. distachyon contain hydroxyectoine and the quaternary\namine (QA) glycine betaine (Supplementary Figure 1).\nPhylogenetic and Pangenome Analyses\nof Pseudomonas Strains Used in the\nStudy\nWe used a set of phylogenetic markers suggested by Mulet et al.\n(2010) to investigate the relatedness of the eight strains used in\nthis study to distinct lineages recognized within the P. fluorescens\nspecies complex. The multilocus sequence analysis based on\nthe concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S\nrRNA), gyrB, rpoB, and rpoD identified R1-43-08 (along with\nstrains 2-79 and SBW25) as a member of the P. fluorescens\nsubgroup (Figure 1). The rest of the strains clustered closely with\nfour additional subgroups of the P. fluorescens complex, namely\nP. corrugata (strains Q2-87 and Q8r1-96), P. koreensis (Pf0-1),\nP. protegens (Pf-5), and P. chlororaphis (30–84). The genomes of\nthe eight rhizosphere Pseudomonas strains varied in size by 1.43\nmegabase (ranging from 5.65 to 7.07 Mb) and contained between\n5,166 and 6,363 protein-coding genes (Figure 2A). The shared\ngene content was characterized with OrthoMCL, which uses allagainst-\nall BLASTp followed by the Markov Cluster algorithm to\nidentify protein groups shared between the compared genomes,\nas well as groups representing species-specific gene expansion\nfamilies (Li et al., 2003). The pangenome analysis revealed a\ncore comprised of approximately 3,179 orthologs that were\nshared among all strains and represented 50.0% to 61.5%\nof each predicted proteome (Figures 2A,B). The non-core\npangenome contained genes shared by two or more (but not\nall) strains and contained between 1,482 and 2,080 orthologs,\nwhich corresponded to 28.7–36.3% of individual proteomes. The\nrest of the predicted protein-coding genes were strain-specific\nsingletons that comprised 7.5% to 15.1% of the strain’s predicted\nproteomes. In respect to divergence from the core genome, strain\nPf-5 was found to possess the highest proportion of unique genes\n(n = 949) followed by 2-79 (n = 887). The entire pangenome of\nthe Pseudomonas strains encompassed over 12,000 homolog and\nsingleton gene families.\nFurther homolog family-based comparisons identified Q8r1-\n96 and R1-43-08 as the most distantly related strains, with\n3349 shared homologs (Supplementary Table 4A). Q8r1-96 and\nQ2-87, which shared 4,489 homologs, were the most closely\nrelated strains. The partitioning of homolog gene families into\nthe core, non-core, and singleton parts of the pangenome agreed\nwith phylogenetic relationships of the strains deduced from the\nanalysis of a selected subset of COGs (Clusters of Orthologous\nGroups) (Figure 2C and Supplementary Tables 4B,C). The\nCOG-based phylogeny supported the multilocus sequence\nanalysis and revealed that the eight Pseudomonas strains form\nthree distinct clusters, the first of which contained 2-79, R1-30-\n84, and SBW25. The second cluster included Q8r1-96 and Q2-87,\nwhereas the third encompassed strains 30-84, Pf-5, and Pf0-1.\nCorrelating the Composition of Root\nExudates With Metabolic Profiles of\nPseudomonas Strains\nWe used the Phenotype MicroArray PM1 and PM2 plates to\nprofile the eight Pseudomonas strains for the utilization of\n190 different carbon sources. Results of the analysis identified\n90 compounds that supported growth and clustered by their\nintensities of utilization into three distinct groups (Figure 3).\nGroup I was comprised of 30 highly metabolized carbon\nsources, which included several amino acids and intermediates of\nglycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, and citrate cycle. Approximately\nhalf of these compounds were catabolized by all eight strains,\nand included several organic acids (fumaric, citric, gluconic,\nmalic, and pyroglutamic), amino acids (Glu, Asn, Gln, Asp, Pro,\nAla, and g-aminobutyric acid), carbohydrates (glucose, mannose,\nand mannitol), and the purine nucleoside inosine. Group II\nwas composed of 44 chemically diverse carbon sources that\nwere variably utilized by the strains. These compounds were\ncarbohydrates, organic acids, amino acids, phenolics, and polyols,\nand included known compatible solutes and intermediates of\nmetabolism of pentoses, galactose, starch, and sucrose. Group\nIII encompassed the rest of the Phenotype MicroArray test\npanel and contained compounds that were not catabolized\nby the tested strains. Among several notable exceptions were\na-hydroxyglutamic acid- g-lactone, putrescine, and itaconic,\ncitramalic, and succinamic acids, which supported the growth\nof strains 2-79, 30-84, Pf-5, and SBW25.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nFIGURE 1 | Neighbor joining phylogeny showing the relationship of the eight strains used in this study (indicated by red triangles) to different species of the\nP. fluorescens complex. The phylogeny was established based on the concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S rRNA), gyrB (subunit B of DNA\ngyrase), rpoB (b subunit of RNA polymerase), and rpoD (sigma 70 factor subunit of RNA polymerase). Distance matrices were calculated by the Jukes-Cantor\nmethod. Colored circles on tree nodes indicate bootstrap values (1,000 replicates) that vary between 60% (smallest circle) and 100% (largest circles).\nB. distachyon Bd21. Interestingly, many carbon sources from\nthe Phenotype MicroArray panel were also present in the root\nexudates of B. distachyon Bd21, and some of these compounds\n(glucose, mannose, galactose, fructose, g-aminobutyric acid,\naspartic acid, citric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, quinic acid,\nalanine, glutamine, and glutamic acid) were catabolized by all\nstrains used in this study, while others (e.g., xylose, trehalose,\nm-inositol) were actively utilized only by certain organisms\n(Figure 3). The comparison of catabolic profiles across the\neight studied Pseudomonas strains revealed the presence of three\ndistinct clusters. The first cluster contained strains Q8r1-96 and\nQ2-87, which consumed very similar sets of carbon sources,\nas well as strain Pf0-1. The second cluster was composed of\n2-79, R1-43-08, SBW25, and 30-84, whereas the third cluster\nwas represented by a single strain, Pf-5. The overall similarity\nof the catabolic profiles partially agreed with the separation\nof the strains into different subgroups of the P. fluorescens\ncomplex (see above).\nAnalysis of the RNA-seq Results\nIn order to understand the cellular responses of rhizosphere\nPseudomonas to plant exometabolites, we analyzed the\ntranscriptome changes in cultures grown in the presence of\nroot exudates. Under field conditions, rhizobacteria colonize\nplant roots in the form of surface-attached microaerobic biofilms\n(Hojberg et al., 1999). To mimic these conditions, the eight\nPseudomonas strains were grown statically at 72% air saturation\nin 21C-glucose medium amended with root exudates and then\nprocessed to extract total RNA (Supplementary Figure 2).\nA total of 995 million raw sequencing reads were generated from\nthe RNA samples by using the Illumina HiSeq-2500 platform,\naveraging 20.7 million reads per sample. The removal of lowquality\nand rRNA sequences resulted in a total of 793 million\nfiltered reads that were mapped onto the eight Pseudomonas\ngenomes with a mean of 7.48 million mapped fragments per\ngenome. The differentially abundant transcripts were identified\nby setting a p value of 0.05 (adjusted for multiple testing) and\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 6 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

(B) The gradual expansion of\nthe pangenome (blue color) and contraction of the core genome (green color) following the sequential addition of genomes from the dataset. Box plots indicate the\n25th and 75th percentiles and medians (horizontal lines) with whiskers corresponding to the 10th and 90th percentiles. The input order was randomized to avoid any\nbias due to the sequential addition of new genomes. The pangenome size increases steadily without reaching a plateau even after the addition of 11,939\nnon-redundant gene families. At the same time, the core genome converged to 3,179 genes. (C) The pangenome-based phylogenomic analysis of the studied\nstrains. Here, the pangenome was defined with OrthoMCL, and orthologous gene sets were then partitioned into the core, singleton, and non-core (the remaining\northolog sets) categories. These categories were calculated for each node in the Maximum Likelihood species tree, using the set of genomes for which that node\nrepresents the ancestor. The results of the ortholog partitioning are shown in pie charts placed at tree nodes. Numbers indicate bootstrap support values. The\nanalysis was conducted in KBase (Arkin et al., 2018).\nthe log2 fold-change (FC) threshold \u2000\u2000 2.0 (Figure 4 and\nSupplementary Tables 5–12). When compared with the control\nconditions, an average of 204 genes per strain were differentially\nexpressed in the presence of root exudates, with the highest\n(n = 425) and lowest (n = 112) numbers observed, respectively,\nin SBW25 and Q2-87 (Figure 4). Overall, more genes were\ninduced than repressed in response to exudates, but the actual\nnumbers in each category varied substantially depending on the\nidentity of the Pseudomonas strain. In most strains, the bulk of\nthe differentially expressed genes was almost equally distributed\nbetween the core (mean, 48.2%) and non-core (mean, 45.8%)\nparts of the genome, whereas the strain-specific singleton genes\nconstituted on average only 5.9% (Figure 4B). One notable\nexception was observed in Q8r1-96, where all differentially\nexpressed genes belonged to the core (73.8%) and non-core\n(26.2%) parts of the genome. Another notable pattern was\nobserved in R1-43-08, where the majority of genes affected by\nthe presence of root exudate fell into the non-core category\n(56.3%). The highest proportion of differentially expressed\nsingletons (11.3 and 10.4%, respectively) was identified in\nstrains SBW25 and Pf-5.\nWe further explored how the identified differentially\nexpressed genes were distributed across genomes of the eight\nstudied rhizosphere strains. The pairwise BLASTp comparisons\nidentified 2-79 and SBW25 as two strains that shared the highest\nnumber of genes (n = 101) induced or repressed in response\nto root exudates (Table 1). The second pair of strains with\na significant number of similar differentially expressed genes\n(n = 86) was Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, which was followed by Pf0-1\nand 30-84, which shared 56 differentially expressed genes. These\npatterns of shared genes were also observed when the results of\nthe pairwise BLASTp comparisons were converted into a binary\ngene presence/absence matrix, which was then subjected to\ncluster analysis using a UPGMA algorithm based on Sorensen’s\ndissimilarity index or examined by non-metric multidimensional\nscaling (NMDS) (Figure 5).\nThe differentially expressed Pseudomonas genes were\nsubjected to Blast2Go analysis and Gene Ontology (GO)\nannotation (Figure 6). Metabolic process, catalytic activity,\nand membrane were the most common annotation terms\nacross the three primary GO term categories (i.e., biological\nprocess, molecular function, and cellular component). A total\nof 1,694 GO terms was assigned to 805 upregulated genes, with\nthe majority of the GO terms related to molecular function\n(682, 40.3%), followed by biological process (669, 39.5%), and\ncellular component (343, 20.2%). In the 539 downregulated gene\ncategory, 1,101 GO terms were assigned to biological process\n(420, 38.1%), molecular function (417, 37.9%), and cellular\ncomponent (264, 24.0%). Within biological process, metabolic\nprocess, cellular process, localization, response to stimulus, and\nregulation were over-represented. Within molecular function,\nthe largest proportion was assigned to catalytic activity, binding,\nand transporter activity categories. Within cellular component,\nthe majority were assigned to membrane, membrane part, cell,\nand cell part categories. Across the eight strains, 37–42% of\ndifferentially expressed genes had no Gene Ontology IDs and\nencoded various conserved hypothetical proteins.\nFunctional Classification of Shared\nDifferentially Expressed Genes\nThe interrogation of RNA-seq data revealed multiple cellular\npathways that were differentially regulated in bacterial cultures\nincubated with root exudates (Supplementary Figures 3, 4).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 7 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nFIGURE 3 | Biolog Phenotype MicroArray profiling the eight rhizosphere\nPseudomonas strains used in the study. The hierarchical clustering analysis\nwas carried out using the average linkage method with Euclidean distances.\nCarbon sources identified by red arrowheads were also detected in the sterile\nroot exudates of B. distachyon Bd21.\nAlthough none of these differentially regulated pathways were\nshared by all eight strains, the cross-strain comparisons revealed\nseveral types of common and specific transcriptomic responses\nthat were elicited by the presence of plant exometabolites\n(Table 2). The visual representation of core gene expression\npatterns is provided in Supplementary Figure 5, which\nshows heatmaps of expression profiles and p-adj values for\ncore genes shared by the studied strains. The figure is\naccompanied by Supplementary Table 13 that lists predicted\nfunctions of genes constituting the four distinct clusters\nobserved after hierarchical clustering of gene expression\nvalues. The first category of shared differentially expressed\npathways functioned in the uptake and catabolism of selected\ncarbohydrates, quaternary ammonium compounds (QAs), and\nphenolics. All strains except for R1-43-08, responded to root\nexudates by inducing the fructose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate\n(PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTSFru). The\ncomponents of this system are encoded by a conserved\noperon and include the cytoplasmic polyprotein EI/HPr/EIIAFru\n(FruB), the 1-phosphofructokinase FruK, and the fructosespecific\npermease EIIBC (FruA) (Chavarria et al., 2016). The\nPTSFru system functions by acquiring high-energy phosphates\nfrom PEP and sequentially passing them, via the EI/HPr/EIIAFru\ndomains of FruB, to the EIIB component of FruA. The\nphosphates are ultimately transferred by the EIIC transporter\nto fructose yielding fructose 1-phosphate, which is channeled\ninto the central metabolic pathways through the action of the\nphosphofructokinase FruK.\nIn all strains except for Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, the exposure to root\nexudates resulted in the induction of two genes adjacent to the\nfru cluster that encoded a Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS)\ntransporter and an L-arabinonate dehydratase (Table 2). These\ngenes are predicted to participate in the uptake and catabolism\nof L-arabinose, where L-arabinonate dehydratase plays an\nimportant role by converting L-arabinonate to 2-dehydro-3-\ndeoxy-L-arabinonate (Rahman et al., 2017). In SBW25, R1-\n43-08, and Q2-87, we also observed the induction of genes\nencoding components of the AraFGH complex, an ATP-Binding\nCassette (ABC) superfamily transporter involved in the import of\narabinose into the cell (Supplementary Tables 6, 7, 9). Finally, all\nstrains except SBW25 and R1-43-08 responded to the presence\nof exudates by upregulating a conserved gene encoding an\naldose epimerase superfamily protein. Such enzymes equilibrate\nalpha- and beta-anomers of aldoses and ensure that stereospecific\nenzymes involved in the metabolism of free sugars do not act as\nmetabolic bottlenecks (Abayakoon et al., 2018). Although some\naldose epimerases have been linked to specific pathways, the\nPseudomonas gene identified in this study could not be assigned\nto a particular metabolic process based on sequence analysis and\ngenomic location.\nSeveral Pseudomonas strains responded to the presence\nof root exudates by upregulating genes involved in the\nuptake and catabolism of myo-inositol and possibly other\nstereoisomers of inositol (Table 2). The upregulated catabolic\ngenes encode the dehydrogenase IolG, which oxidizes myoinositol\nto its corresponding ketone, as well as IolE, IolD, IolB,\nand IolC that collectively convert the 2-keto-myo-inositol to\nacetyl-CoA and the glycolysis intermediate dihydroxyacetone\nphosphate (Yoshida et al., 2008; Kohler et al., 2011).

The cross-genome comparisons revealed\nthat in all studied strains except for Pf0-1, components\nof the myo-inositol utilization pathway were encoded\nwithin a well-conserved gene cluster which, in addition to\ncatabolic and transport functions, also encodes a dedicated\ntranscriptional repressor.\nAll studied strains of Pseudomonas carry multiple genes\ninvolved in scavenging the quaternary ammonium compounds\ncholine, glycine betaine (GB), carnitine, choline-O-sulfate, and\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 9 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

Many of these genes were\ndifferentially expressed, including those encoding parts of the\nABC transporter CbcXWV, which is predicted to function in\nthe uptake of choline under water-replete conditions (Table 2).\nAmong enzymes induced in the presence of root exudates were\nthe choline dehydrogenase BetA, which converts choline to\nglycine betaine and a network of enzymes (i.e., the Rieske family\noxygenase GbcAB, the dimethyglycine demethylase DgcAB, and\nthe sarcosine oxidase SoxBDAG) that sequentially convert GB\nto glycine. In 2-79 and SBW25, this group of differentially\nregulated genes also included an AraC-family transcriptional\nactivator GbdR, which perceives intercellular levels of GB and\ninduces genes involved in the transport and catabolism of\nglycine betaine and detoxification of the catabolic byproducts\n(Hampel et al., 2014).\nThe last category of activated catabolic pathways included the\ncatechol branch of the b-ketoadipate pathway for the degradation\nof aromatic compounds. In strains 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5,\ngrowth on root exudates resulted in upregulation of catechol-\n1,2-dioxygenase, muconate cycloisomerase, and muconolactone\nisomerase, which collectively cleave the catechol ring and\nconvert it to b-ketoadipate enol-lactone (Harwood and Parales,\n1996). Finally, analysis of the P. synxantha 2-79 transcriptome\nidentified an induction of benABC genes encoding subunits\nof benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase, an oxidoreductase that generates\ncatechol from benzoate.\nIn addition to various catabolic pathways, the exposure to root\nexudates also induced several genes involved in the homeostasis\nof copper (Table 2). Four of these genes form a conserved cluster\nin genomes of the strains and encode the periplasmic coppersensing\ntwo-component system CinRS, the plastocyanin/azurinlike\nprotein CinA, and the NADPH-dependent pre-Q0 reductase\nCinQ. Also, in strains Q2-87, 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, we observed\nupregulation of a conserved operon encoding the multicopper\noxidase CopA, the periplasmic copper-binding protein CopC, the\ninner membrane protein CopD, and outer membrane protein\nCopB. In several Gram-negative bacteria, these Cop proteins are\nthought to have dual functions and participate both in the uptake\nof essential copper as well as in the sequestration of excess copper\nin the periplasm and outer membrane.\nThe analysis of shared downregulated pathways revealed that\nmost of the strains respond to the presence of root exudates by\nrepressing genes involved in the uptake and catabolism of sulfur\ncompounds (Table 2). In strains SBW25, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96,\nQ2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, this response involved the ssuEADCB\noperon responsible for the utilization of alkanesulfonates\nas sulfur sources. The ssu operon is highly conserved in\nfluorescent pseudomonads and encodes the FMNH2-dependent\nmonooxygenase SsuD and the NAD (P)H-dependent FMN\nreductase SsuE, which together catalyze the desulfonation of\nalkanesulfonates. Also, the ssu locus contains genes for the\nmolybdopterin-binding protein SsuF and the alkanesulfonatespecific\nABC-type transporter consisting of the sulfonate\nsubstrate-binding protein SsuA, sulfonate permease protein\nSsuC, and sulfonate transport ATP-binding protein SsuB. Finally,\nin R1-43-08, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, growth on root exudates\ncoincided with repression of the tauABCD operon, which\nallows these strains to utilize taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonate)\nas a sulfur source. The repressed tau genes encoded the\n2-oxoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenase TauD and\nsubstrate-binding, ATP-binding, and permease components of\nthe taurine-specific ABC transporter TauABC.\nOther Differentially Expressed Pathways\nIn addition to their effect on several shared cellular pathways,\ngrowth on root exudates resulted in the induction or repression of\nnumerous strain-specific genes. In closely related P. synxantha 2-\n79 and P. fluorescens SBW25, we observed differential expression\nof genes involved in energy metabolism, transport of amino\nacids, and surface attachment (Supplementary Tables 5, 6).\nOther notable differentially expressed pathways included 2–\n79 gene clusters that encode enzymes for the catabolism of\ntrehalose, a prophage, and toxin/antitoxin system, as well as the\nSBW25 operon predicted to control the synthesis of the capsular\nexopolysaccharide colonic acid. The response of Pseudomonas sp.\nR1-43-08 to root exudates also involved differential expression\nof different energy metabolism pathways. In addition, we\nobserved the upregulation of genes involved in the uptake and\ncatabolism of xylose (also upregulated in 2–79) and repression\nof enzymes for the biosynthesis of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid\nand assimilation of inorganic sulfur and L-cysteine biosynthesis\n(Supplementary Table 7).\nThe analysis of the Q8r1-96 transcriptome revealed\nperturbation of different metabolic pathways including genes\nencoding components of cytochrome C oxidase, transport\nand catabolism of sorbitol/mannitol, metabolism of butanoic\nacid, and biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides alginate and\npoly-b-1-6-N-acetylglucosamine (Supplementary Table 8). In\nP. fluorescens Q2-87, we identified differential expression of\ngenes involved in metabolism of galactose, tryptophan, tyrosine,\nglycine, serine, and threonine (Supplementary Table 9),\nwhile in P. chlororaphis 30-84, growth on exudates activated\nthe biosynthesis of molybdopterin cofactor, catabolism of\ngalactonate and acetoin, and uptake and catabolism of putrescine\n(Supplementary Table 10). The response of P. protegens Pf-5 to\nroot exudates involved upregulation of acetoin dehydrogenase,\nwhich converts acetoin to acetaldehyde and acetyl-CoA, as\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 10 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

The terms were derived from 93 different functional groups (GO subcategories level 4). The GO terms were assigned with Blast2GO (Conesa\nand Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al., 2018). On a WEGO histogram, the percentage of 100 is defined as the total number of genes assigned a GO\nterm. However, the subcategories do not add up to 100% because many genes fall into more than one functional class and are therefore annotated by multiple GO\nterms.\nwell as pathways for the utilization of glycolate and putrescine\n(Supplementary Table 11). Also induced were genes for\nthe production of pyrrolnitrin and PhlG hydrolase, which\nmodulate the metabolic loads attributed to the synthesis of\n2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol. The differentially expressed genes of\nP. fluorescens Pf0-1 included, among others, operons encoding\ncytochrome C oxidase and enzymes for catabolism of malonic\nacid (Supplementary Table 12). Yet another interesting\nfinding involved the induction of assorted genes acting in the\nhomeostasis of iron and defense against reactive oxygen species\n(ROS). We observed activation of iron dicitrate transporters\n(SBW25 and 30-84), genes for the biosynthesis of siderophores\nornicorrugatin (SBW25) and pyochelin (Pf-5), heme-degrading\nenzymes (2–79, 30–84), TonB siderophore receptors, and\ncomponents of the energy-transducing inner membrane\ncomplex TonB-ExbB-ExbD (2–79 and Pf-5). The differentially\nexpressed ROS defense pathways were represented by different\ncatalases in strains 2–79, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and\nPf-5 and organic hydroperoxide resistance proteins in strains\nSBW25 and R1-43-08.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nsoil microorganisms. Our results were in agreement with a\nrecent report of 27 different sugars, amino acids, and organic\nacids in Brachypodium exudates (Kawasaki et al., 2016). We\nconfirmed the presence of exometabolites identified in that\nstudy, along with dozens of additional analytes that were\nidentified by matching their mass-spectra and retention indices\nto the LECO/Fiehn Metabolomics library (Supplementary\nTable 3). The complementation of the metabolomic analysis\nwith profiling of the bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays\nrevealed that a substantial proportion of the characterized\nexudate constituents were catabolized by a collection of eight\nPseudomonas strains from across the P. fluorescens group that is\nknown to form associations with plant roots. The amendment\nof Pseudomonas cultures with root exudates caused changes in\nthe expression of multiple genes encoding catabolic and anabolic\nenzymes, predicted transporters, transcriptional regulators, stress\nresponse, and conserved hypothetical proteins. In most strains,\nthese differentially expressed genes were almost equally split\nbetween the core and variable genome regions, mirroring\nthe substantial strain-to-strain variation in the genome size\nand gene content within the P. fluorescens species complex\n(Loper et al., 2012).\nThe analysis of transcriptome responses to root exudates\nrevealed several types of cellular pathways present in the strains\nused in this study. The first category of such pathways was\ninvolved in the catabolism of carbohydrates such as fructose,\narabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, trehalose, and galactose. Among\nthese catabolic traits, the ability to utilize fructose as a carbon\nsource is highly conserved among fluorescent pseudomonads.\nIn contrast, growth on arabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, and\ntrehalose is variably present and was traditionally used to\ndifferentiate species and biovars within the P. fluorescens\ngroup (Barrett et al., 1986). We speculate that such variably\ndistributed pathways contribute to the differential affinity of\npseudomonads toward host plants and/or to determine which\nstrains flourish in response to growing roots and changing\nenvironments. Several independent studies have confirmed\nthe importance of carbohydrate catabolism pathways for the\nbiology of rhizosphere pseudomonads. For example, in vivo\nexpression technology (IVET) profiling of P. fluorescens SBW25\nidentified xylose isomerase among genome regions essential\nfor the colonization of sugar beet seedlings (Liu et al., 2015),\nwhereas a genome-wide Tn-Seq screen of Pseudomonas simiae\nidentified genes for the catabolism of myo-inositol among traits\nessential for the colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana roots\n(Cole et al., 2017).\nThe response of rhizosphere Pseudomonas to Brachypodium\nroot exudates also involved pathways for the uptake and\nmetabolism of amino acids. We observed differential\nexpression of genes encoding the hydrophobic (HAAT) and\npolar (PAAT) amino acid uptake transporters in strains\n2-79, SBW25, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5. Other related genes\nencoded enzymes for the catabolism of valine and glutamic\nacid (2-79); metabolism of tryptophan, glycine, serine, and\nthreonine (Q2-87); and biosynthesis of methionine (Q8r1-\n96). It is plausible that the abundance of amino acids in\nroot exudates is also linked to the repression of pathways\ninvolved in the catabolism of sulfonates and taurine that\nwas observed in several strains (Table 2). Although the\npreferred source of sulfur for P. fluorescens is unknown, in the\nclosely related P. aeruginosa, the sulfur starvation response\nis triggered by the growth on any sulfur compound other\nthan sulfate, thiocyanate, and cysteine (Hummerjohann et al.,\n1998). This fact, together with the presence of cysteine and\ncystine in the root exudates, suggest that root exudates of\nBrachypodium may serve as an important source of sulfur for\nrhizosphere Pseudomonas. These findings also agree well with\nthe reported scarcity of inorganic sulfate in the soil, and the\npresence of sulfur mostly in the form of organic compounds,\nincluding amino acids, proteins, sulfate esters, and sulfonates\n(Autry and Fitzgerald, 1990).\nAnother interesting result of this study was the concerted\nactivation of copper and iron homeostasis pathways observed\nin all of the Pseudomonas strains used in this work. In bacteria,\nan excess of copper is toxic and triggers oxidative stress due to\nthe formation of free radicals, as well as disruption of protein\nmetalation and stability of iron-sulfur clusters (Bondarczuk\nand Piotrowska-Seget, 2013). On the other hand, copper is an\nessential trace element used as a cofactor in different enzymes.\nSimilarly, although elevated levels of iron cause redox stress, this\nelement is also found in active energy metabolism enzymes and is\ncrucial for bacterial growth (Andrews et al., 2003). The analysis\nof metal homeostasis genes identified in this study suggests\nthat their induction was likely triggered by the deficiency of\ncopper and iron in bacterial cultures grown in the presence of\nroot exudates. We attribute this effect to the ability of some\ncomponents of root exudates to chelate soil metals.\nDespite the abundance of iron in the soil, its bioavailability\nis limited due to the low solubility of Fe (III) oxyhydrates\nat neutral pH. The non-graminaceous plants circumvent this\nproblem by acidifying the rhizosphere and secreting flavins,\nphenolics, and organic acids that chelate iron. The reduction\nof these ferric chelates releases soluble ferrous iron taken up\nby root cells (Kobayashi and Nishizawa, 2012). Graminaceous\nplants, like Brachypodium, acquire iron by secreting into the\nsoil non-protein amino acids of the mugineic acid (MA) group,\nwhich act as Fe (III)-chelating phytosiderophores. In addition to\niron, low-molecular-weight organic acids and phytosiderophores\nbind other divalent and trivalent metals (including copper) and\ncontribute to heavy-metal tolerance in plants (Chen et al., 2017).\nIt is plausible that the presence of these plant exometabolites\nis responsible for the deficit of iron and copper observed in\nPseudomonas cultures grown in the presence of root exudates.\nThese results further underscore the importance of diverse and\nredundant metal homeostasis pathways found in genomes of the\nP. fluorescens group for the ability of these organisms to colonize\nand persist in the plant rhizosphere.\nRecently, Klonowska et al. (2018) examined transcriptomic\nresponses of symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria to root\nexudates of the legume plant Mimosa pundica, which has\nan unusual ability to support both alpha- (Rhizobium) and\nbeta-rhizobia (Cupriavidus and Burkholderia). Using RNA-seq,\nthe authors characterized genes involved in the perception of\nroot exudates in the nodulating bacteria Burkholderia phymatum\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 14 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nSTM815, Cupriavidus taiwanensis LMG19424, and Rhizobium\nmesoamericanum STM3625. Interestingly, the analysis of\ndifferentially expressed genes revealed induction of pathways\ninvolved in the catabolism of fructose, xylose, myo-inositol,\nand protocatechuate/catechol. Also upregulated were some\ncopper homeostasis, siderophore biosynthesis, and oxidative\nstress genes. Finally, the analytical profiling of M. pundica\nexudates revealed an overlap with Brachypodium in the types of\ncarbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids present. These\nfindings suggest that differentially expressed genes shared by\nmultiple strains of the group P. fluorescens are not unique to\nthe Brachypodium-Pseudomonas system but represent a set\nof conserved cellular pathways involved in the perception of\nplant exometabolites by different clades of rhizosphere-dwelling\nProteobacteria.\nMost strains included in this study were originally selected\nbased on the ability to colonize the rhizosphere and produce\nsecondary metabolites that alleviate the plant stress response\nand/or inhibit soilborne pathogens. It has been suggested\nthat plant metabolites released into the rhizosphere affect\nthe biocontrol activity of plant-beneficial pseudomonads (de\nWerra et al., 2011). We provide further support to this\nhypothesis by demonstrating that in some strains, root exudates\nmodulate the expression of genes for the catabolism of\nthe plant growth-promoting metabolites acetoin and 2,3-\nbutanediol. The exposure to exudates also affected the expression\nof genes for the synthesis of well-characterized antifungal\ncompounds pyrrolnitrin, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, and 2,4-\ndiacetylphloroglucinol. The modulatory effects were strainspecific,\nsuggesting significant differences in the regulatory\nnetworks involved in the perception of plant signals and\nregulation of the production of antibiotics and growthpromoting\nmetabolites.\nThe final significant finding of this study was the induction\nof catabolism of quaternary amines (QAs) observed in multiple\nstrains of the P. fluorescens group during growth on root\nexudates. This observation was supported by the detection of\nglycine betaine in the root secretions of B. distachyon. The\npresence of QAs in plant tissues and the capacity of these\nmetabolites to provide stress protection and nutrients to plant\npathogens and symbionts were reported before (Boncompagni\net al., 1999; Chen et al., 2013; Kabbadj et al., 2017), but our\nstudy is among the first to highlight the potential importance of\nthese metabolites for rhizosphere interactions. Pseudomonads do\nnot synthesize QAs de novo but have evolved many pathways to\nscavenge them from eukaryotic hosts, where these metabolites\nare abundant due to the prominence of phosphatidylcholine\nin cellular membranes. Strains of P. fluorescens carry genes\nfor the conversion of choline, carnitine, and glycine betaine to\nglycine, as well as quaternary amine transporters of the BCCT\nand ABC families that are also conserved in the opportunistic\nhuman pathogen P. aeruginosa and the plant pathogen P. syringae\n(Galvao et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2013; Wargo, 2013b).\nIn P. aeruginosa, choline catabolism genes are essential for\nthe ability of this pathogen to persist during lung infection\n(Wargo, 2013a). Similarly, a P. syringae mutant deficient in\nBetT, OpuC, and CbcXWV quaternary amine transporters had\nreduced fitness during colonization of bean and soybean leaves\nunder greenhouse and field conditions (Chen et al., 2013).\nDepending on water availability, P. aeruginosa and P. syringae\ncatabolize exogenously supplied QAs as carbon and nitrogen\nsources or accumulate them as osmoprotectants (Chen et al.,\n2013; Wargo, 2013b). Our ongoing work in P. synxantha 2–\n79 unraveled similar physiological responses and demonstrated\nthat QA transporters function differentially and redundantly\nin the uptake of quaternary amines as nutrients (Pablo and\nMavrodi, unpublished). In contrast, under water stress, the QAs\ncholine, betaine, and carnitine are accumulated preferentially for\nosmoprotection. Under drought stress, a 2–79 mutant devoid\nof all known QA transporters was less competitive in the\ncolonization of the Brachypodium rhizosphere than its wild-type\nparental strain. Interestingly, our metabolomic profiling of root\nexudates also revealed proline, glutamine, and hydroxyectoine.\nThese metabolites act as compatible solutes in different groups\nof microorganisms (Yancey et al., 1982; Empadinhas and da\nCosta, 2008), suggesting an important role of root exudates\nin the ability of Pseudomonas to persist in the rhizosphere of\ndrought-stressed plants.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe original contributions presented in the study are publicly\navailable.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nINTRODUCTION\nPlants are meta-organisms or holobionts that rely in part on\ntheir microbiome for specific functions and traits. The ability\nof the plant microbiome to influence plant development, vigor,\nhealth, and fitness in response to abiotic stressors associated\nwith global climate change is documented by numerous studies\n(Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009). There is mounting evidence\nthat plants actively recruit beneficial microbiomes, but many\naspects of this process are still very much a black box (Reinhold-\nHurek et al., 2015). The foundation for the differential affinity\nof rhizobacteria toward host plants is built upon complex\nchemical cross talk between microorganisms and plant roots.\nUp to 40% of photosynthetically fixed carbon is released by\nplant roots in the form of exudates and secretions, lysates, and\nmucilages (Curl and Truelove, 1986; Lynch, 1990; Whipps, 1990;\nBadri and Vivanco, 2009). The release of these compounds is\nactively controlled in response to environmental stimuli, and the\ncomposition of root exudates varies greatly according to plant\nspecies and physiological condition (Lynch, 1990; Nguyen, 2003;\nPhillips et al., 2004; De-la-Pena et al., 2008). The presence and\ncomposition of exudates strongly impact soil microorganisms,\nwhich is consistent with the idea that plants actively select and\nshape their root microbiota (Zolla et al., 2013).\nPrimary root exudates include simple and complex sugars,\namino acids, polypeptides and proteins, organic, aliphatic and\nfatty acids, sterols, and phenolics (Nguyen, 2003; Badri and\nVivanco, 2009; Badri et al., 2009). These compounds serve as\ncarbon and energy sources for rhizobacteria, and the presence\nof the intact corresponding catabolic pathways is essential\nfor competitive colonization of roots and disease suppression\n(Lugtenberg et al., 2001; Kamilova et al., 2005; Lugtenberg and\nKamilova, 2009). Root exudates also contain numerous signal\nmolecules and secondary metabolites, the significance of which\nis only now emerging (Walker et al., 2003; Bais et al., 2005,\n2006). A handful of analyses of plant-induced gene expression\nby transcriptional profiling in vitro (Mark et al., 2005) or in\nthe rhizosphere (Silby and Levy, 2004; Ramos-Gonzalez et al.,\n2005; Matilla et al., 2007; Barret et al., 2009) have identified\nmultiple genes that are differentially regulated by exposure to\nroots or root exudates. Bacterial pathways expressed during\nrhizosphere colonization control utilization of plant-derived\nmetabolites (Simons et al., 1996, 1997; Camacho-Carvajal, 2001;\nLugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), motility and chemotaxis (de\nWeert et al., 2002; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), phase\nvariation (Dekkers et al., 1998; Sanchez-Contreras et al., 2002;\nvan den Broek et al., 2005), outer membrane integrity (de Weert\net al., 2006; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), and the ability\nto sequester limiting resources (Raaijmakers et al., 1995) and\nresist environmental stresses (Sarniguet et al., 1995; Miller and\nWood, 1996; van Veen et al., 1997; Schnider-Keel et al., 2001). In\nits spatial and temporal properties, root colonization resembles\nbiofilm formation, and biofilm-related pathways also have been\nimplicated in adhesion to seeds and roots and rhizosphere\ncolonization (Espinosa-Urgel et al., 2000; Hinsa et al., 2003;\nYousef-Coronado et al., 2008; Fuqua, 2010; Martinez-Gil et al.,\n2010; Nielsen et al., 2011; Zboralski and Filion, 2020). Finally,\nroot exudates strongly affect the expression of diverse plant\ngrowth promotion and biocontrol genes (Vacheron et al., 2013).\nOver the past decade, the genomes of numerous rhizosphere\nstrains have been sequenced and analyzed, but functional\ngenomics studies of rhizosphere competence lag behind the\navailability of sequence data.\nThis study explored the molecular dialog between the\nmodel host plant Brachypodium distachyon and several wellcharacterized\nrhizosphere strains of the Pseudomonas fluorescens\ngroup. Brachypodium is a small annual grass originating in semiarid\nregions of the Middle East that has emerged as a prime model\nfor economically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops\nof the grass family (Bevan et al., 2010; Schwartz et al., 2010;\nBrkljacic et al., 2011; Hong et al., 2011; Tyler et al., 2014). The\nbiology, extensive collection of resources, and research tools\nmake B. distachyon an attractive model to investigate interactions\nbetween plants and root-associated microbes. Pseudomonads\nare ubiquitous Gram-negative g-proteobacteria that colonize\neukaryotic hosts and include both commensals and economically\nimportant pathogens of plants and animals (Moore et al.,\n2006; Schroth et al., 2006; Yahr and Parsek, 2006). The genus\nPseudomonas currently comprises > 100 named species that have\nbeen separated based on multilocus sequence analysis into 14\nspecies groups (Garrido-Sanz et al., 2016; Hesse et al., 2018).\nThe P. fluorescens group is the most diverse regarding both\nthe genetic distances within it, the number of species and the\nlarge pangenome that makes up > 50% of the pangenome\nof the genus as a whole (Loper et al., 2012). The group also\nencompasses an unusually high proportion of strains that inhabit\nthe plant rhizosphere and possess plant growth promoting and\nbiocontrol properties. Naylor et al. (2017) profiled bacterial\ncommunities associated with root tissues and rhizosphere of\n18 different plant species of the Poaceae family. That study\nidentified Pseudomonas among taxa constituting the core grass\nroot microbiome and demonstrated that these bacteria were\nenriched in C3 plants, including wheat, rye, barley, oat, and\nBrachypodium. We confirmed the capacity of B. distachyon\nBd21 to serve as a host for rhizobacteria of the P. fluorescens\ngroup in preliminary greenhouse assays with biocontrol strains\nP. synxantha 2-79, P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96, and P. protegens\nPf-5. Results of these experiments revealed that all strains\nsuccessfully established and colonized the roots of Brachypodium\n(Supplementary Table 1).\nIn this study, we focused on eight well-studied strains\nof the P. fluorescens complex that are supported by years\nof studies, numerous refereed publications, and high-quality\ngenome sequences. By profiling transcriptomes of these strains\nduring growth in root exudates of B. distachyon, we revealed the\ndiversity of cellular pathways and physiological responses that\nunderlie the establishment of mutualistic interactions between\nbeneficial rhizobacteria and the host plant. Our results also\nconfirmed that root exudates contain carbohydrates, amino acids,\norganic acids, and phenolics that serve as carbon and energy\nsources for rhizobacteria. The root exudates also contained\nosmoprotectants that may help microorganisms to persist in the\nrhizosphere of drought-stressed plants.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nthe variable genome in adaptation of individual strains of\nPseudomonas to the rhizosphere lifestyle.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacterial Strains Used in the Study\nThe eight Pseudomonas strains used for this study are\nP. synxantha 2-79 (Thomashow and Weller, 1988), P. fluorescens\nSBW25 (Silby et al., 2009), Pseudomonas sp. R1-43-08 (Parejko\net al., 2012), P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96 (Raaijmakers and Weller,\n1998), P. fluorescens Q2-87 (Bangera and Thomashow, 1996),\nP. chlororaphis 30-84 (Thomashow et al., 1990), P. fluorescens\nPf0-1 (Silby et al., 2009), and P. protegens Pf-5 (Howell and\nStipanovic, 1980). The selected organisms have been studied\nextensively for their role in biological control and plant\ngrowth promotion (Supplementary Table 2). The strains were\nmaintained in the laboratory as frozen stocks (\U0010000080\u2000C) and\nroutinely cultured in King’s medium B (King et al., 1954) or\n21C medium, which contained (per 1 L): 1.0 g of NH4Cl, 3.5 g\nof Na2HPO4\u20002H2O, 2.8 g of KH2PO4, 3.0 g of glucose, and\n20 ml of a microelement solution (Smibert and Kreig, 1994;\nHalverson and Firestone, 2000).\nPropagation of Plants and Collection of\nRoot Exudates\nB. distachyon Bd21 was established from seed material obtained\nfrom the USDA-ARS Plant Germplasm Introduction and Testing\nResearch Unit (Pullman, WA, United States). Brachypodium\nseeds were imbibed for 3 days at 4\u2000C and sown in 7 \u2000 7 cm\npots filled with Sunshine Potting Mix #4 (Sun Gro Horticulture,\nAgawam, MA, United States). Plants were grown in an IR-\n89X (Percival Scientific, Perry, IA, United States) controlled\nenvironment chamber retrofitted with 6500K and 3000K T5 54W\ngrow lights (Spectralux) under a 20-h light, 24\u2000C/4-h dark, 18\u2000C\ncycle. Plants were watered and fertilized with Jack’s professional\nwater-soluble fertilizer (20:20:20) (JR Peters, Allentown, PA,\nUnited States). After 12 weeks and plant senescence, seeds\nwere collected, processed, and stored under desiccant and dark\nconditions at room temperature.\nTo collect root exudates, seeds of B. distachyon Bd21 were\nsurface-sterilized, pregerminated, and placed in sterile 1 L widemouth\nglass jars containing 113 g of 6-mm glass beads and\n25 ml distilled water. Jars were covered with vented caps\nand plants were grown hydroponically in an environmental\ncontrolled growth chamber under conditions described above.\nAfter 6 days, root exudates were extracted from individual\njars and their sterility was confirmed by spotting on nutrient\nagar. Multiple batches of root exudates were collected, filtered\n(0.22 mm), aliquoted in Falcon tubes (10 ml), lyophilized, and\nstored at –80\u2000C.\nMetabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates\nExudates were analyzed for primary metabolites at the Murdock\nMetabolomics Laboratory at Washington State University\n(Pullman, WA, United States). Freeze-dried residues were\nsuspended in 500 ml 50% aqueous acetonitrile and clarified by\ncentrifugation for 20 min at 21,000 \u2000 g and 4\u2000C. The liquid\nchromatography mass spectrometry analysis was conducted\nwith a Synapt G2-S quadrupole-ion mobility spectrometrytime\nof flight mass spectrometer system equipped with an\nacquity ultra-performance liquid chromatograph (UPLC) and\nan acquity photodiode array detector (all from Waters, Milford,\nMA, United States). The exudate metabolites were separated\non a SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC HPLC column (2.1 \u2000 100 mm,\n3 mm) (Milllipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, United States) using\nacetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid as solvent B and water\nwith 0.1% formic acid as solvent A at a flow rate of 400 ml\nmin\U001000001 and the following linear gradient extending over 14 min:\n0 min, 80% B; 4 min, 80% B, 6 min: 10% B; 7.5 min, 10%\nB; 10 min, 80% B; and 14 min, 80% B. Mass spectra were\ncollected in positive ion mode over a range of m/z 50–1,200\nwith a scan time of 0.2 s. The Q-TOF-MS source was at\n3.0 kV and 120\u2000C; the sampling cone at 40 V, desolvation\ntemperature was 250\u2000C; cone gas and desolvation gas flow were\nat 0 and 850 L h\U001000001, respectively. Leucine enkephalin was used\nfor post-acquisition mass correction. Target compounds were\nvisualized using selected ion chromatograms at 0.05 Da window\nwidth. The compound identification was based on comparison\nof chromatographic behavior and accurate masses to those of\nauthentic standards.\nFor gas chromatography, derivatization was carried out using\na modification of the procedure of Lee and Fiehn (2008).\nThe freeze-dried residues were suspended in 950 ml aqueous\nmethanol (84%, v/v) and clarified by centrifugation for 15 min\nat 21,000 \u2000 g at 4\u2000C. The supernatants were spiked with 1\nmg of the internal standard salicylic acid-d6 (C/D/N Isotopes,\nQuebec, Canada) and dried in vacuo. The dry residues were\nsuspended in 10 ml of O-methoxylamine hydrochloride (30 mg\nml\U001000001 in anhydrous pyridine, both from Millipore Sigma) and\nincubated while mixing (1,000 RPM) for 90 min at 30\u2000C.\nSubsequently, samples were derivatized with 90 ml of MSTFA\nwith 1% TMCS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,\nUnited States) for 30 min at 37\u2000C. Gas chromatography-mass\nspectroscopy analysis was performed using a Pegasus 4D timeof-\nflight mass spectrometer (LECO, Saint Joseph MI) equipped\nwith a MPS2 autosampler (Gerstel, Linthicum, MD) and a 7890A\noven (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States).\nThe derivatization products were separated on a 30-m, 0.25 mm\ni.d., 0.25 mm df Rxi-5Sil column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA,\nUnited States) with an IntegraGuard precolumn using ultrapure\nHe at a constant flow of 0.9 ml min\U001000001 as carrier gas. The linear\nthermal gradient started with a 1-min hold at 70\u2000C, followed\nby a ramp to 300\u2000C at 10\u2000C min\U001000001. The final temperature was\nheld for 5 min prior to returning to initial conditions. Mass\nspectra were collected at 17 spectra s\U001000001. Peak identification was\nconducted using the Fiehn primary metabolite library (Kind\net al., 2009) and an identity score cutoff of 700. Additionally,\nauthentic standards for a number of primary metabolites were\nanalyzed under identical conditions and the data used to compare\nthe chromatographic behavior. Peak alignment and spectrum\ncomparisons were carried out using the Statistical Compare\nfeature of ChromaTOF software (LECO).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 3 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nIsolation of RNA From Bacteria Cultured\nin Root Exudates and RNA-Seq\nThe strains were pregrown overnight at 25\u2000C on 21C-glucose\nagar and then subcultured into 96-well microplates containing\nliquid 21C-glucose medium amended with Brachypodium\nexudates. The liquid medium was prepared by dissolving the\nlyophilized root exudate material in an appropriate volume of\n21C-glucose medium to concentrate root exudates 20-fold. The\ngrowth medium was sterilized by passing it through a 0.22-\nmm membrane filter. The control cultures were grown under\nidentical conditions in the absence of exudates. All treatments\nwere inoculated at OD600 of 0.1 and incubated for 20 to\n22 h until cultures entered late-exponential growth phase at\n25\u2000C in an atmosphere of 15% oxygen [created by a ProOx\nP110 oxygen controller (BioSpherix, Parish, NY, United States)\nwith a hypoxia C-chamber]. The cells were stabilized by the\naddition RNAprotect reagent (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD,\nUnited States) and total RNA was purified using a RNeasy Protect\nBacteria Mini Kit (QIAGEN) from three biological replicates of\neach strain cultured under control conditions and in exudates.\nThe quality assessment of the extracted RNA samples was\nperformed with a NanoDrop OneC Spectrophotometer (Thermo\nFisher Scientific) and a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies)\nand revealed A260/A280 and A260/A230 values of > 2.0 and a mean\nRNA integrity numbers (RIN) value of > 9.2.\nThree biological replicates of RNA samples were shipped on\ndry ice to the DOE Joint Genome Institute (Walnut Creek, CA,\nUnited States), where rRNA was depleted and stranded RNASeq\nlibraries were prepared, quantified by qPCR and sequenced\nusing a HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina). The fastq file reads\nwere filtered and processed with BBDuk1 to remove reads that\ncontained 1 or more “N” bases, had an average quality score\nacross the read less than 10 or had a minimum length < 51 bp\nor 33% of the full read length. Reads mapped with BBMap (see\ntext footnote 2) to masked human, cat, dog, and mouse references\nat 93% identity were removed. Another category of removed\nsequences matched RNA spike-in, PhiX, common microbial\ncontaminants, and ribosomal RNAs. The processed reads from\neach library were aligned to the reference genome using BBMap\nwith only unique mappings allowed (BAMs/directory). If a\nread mapped to more than one location it was ignored.\nfeatureCounts (Liao et al., 2014) was used to generate raw\ngene counts, which were normalized to adjust for the length of\neach gene and total number of reads mapped for each library.\nThe normalization formula used: n = [r/(l/1,000)]/(t/1,000,000),\nwhere n = normalized read count for gene (G) for library (L);\nr = raw read count for gene G for library L; l = gene G length; and\nt = total reads mapped for library L. Raw gene counts were used to\nevaluate the level of correlation between biological samples using\nPearson’s correlation.\nBioinformatic Analysis\nCount tables generated by the JGI RNA-Seq pipeline were input\ninto DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) to normalize and determine\n1https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/\ndifferential expression. Statistical significance was established\nthrough DESeq2 by using three biological replicates for control\nand root exudate conditions. Scatterplots were generated from\nthe DESeq2 data table outputs using ggplot2. Genes differentially\nexpressed between control and root exudate samples (log2 foldchanges\n–2 \u2000 to \u2000 2, adjusted p value \u2000 0.05) were used in\ndownstream analysis. The core genome and pangenome for the\nPseudomonas strains used in this study were computed using the\nOthoMCL v.2.0, Species Tree Builder v.2.2.0, and Phylogenetic\nPangenome Accumulation v1.4.0 apps implemented in the U.S.\nDepartment of Energy Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase)\n(Arkin et al., 2018). Additional comparisons were conducted\nwith the PGAweb pangenome analysis pipeline (Chen et al.,\n2018). Differentially expressed genes were assigned to core,\nnon-core, and singleton parts of each strain’s proteome by\nBLASTp with an E value cutoff of e-06, identity of 40%\nand coverage of 60%. Functional annotation of differentially\nexpressed genes was carried out with the Blast2GO (Conesa\nand Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al.,\n2018). Additional manual curation was performed using tools\nimplemented in the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG)\ndatabase (Markowitz et al., 2012), Pseudomonas Genome\nDatabase (Winsor et al., 2009), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and\nGenomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa et al., 2008), and Geneious 10.2.3\n(Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand). Metabolic functions\nencoded by the differentially expressed genes were mapped\nusing iPath 3.0 (Darzi et al., 2018). Phylogenetic analyses\nwere carried out by building multiple sequence alignments\nwith MAFFT v7.222 (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and inferring\nneighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenies with Geneious Tree Builder.\nThe resultant phylogenetic trees were visualized with iTOL\n(Letunic and Bork, 2016). Reproducibility of clades within the\ninferred NJ trees was assessed by bootstrap resampling with\n1,000 replicates.\nCharacterization of Carbon Source\nUtilization With Biolog Phenotype\nMicroarrays\nThe utilization of carbon sources was analyzed using Phenotype\nMicroArrays (Biolog, Hayward, CA, United States) as follows.\nThe bacteria were cultured overnight on Luria-Bertani agar\nat 25\u2000C, after which cells were harvested and suspended in\ninoculating fluid (IF-0). The transmittance of the suspension\nwas adjusted to 42% using a Biolog turbidimeter. The cell\nsuspension was mixed with IF\U001000000 containing Dye Mix A\n(Biolog) to achieve a final transmittance of 85%. One hundred\nmicroliter aliquots of the adjusted cell suspension were\ninoculated into PM01 and PM02A plates, which were then\nincubated in an OmniLog Phenotype MicroArray System\n(Biolog) at 25\u2000C for 48 h. The formation of formazan was\nrecorded at 15 min intervals, and data were analyzed using\nOmniLog Parametric Analysis software v1.20.02 (Biolog).\nRelative growth of the studied strains was normalized to\ngrowth on D-glucose and visualized using Heatmapper\n(Babicki et al., 2016).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 4 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

These\nmetabolites included (i) carbohydrates and their derivatives\n(glucose, fructose, xylose, sucrose, trehalose, maltose, galactose,\nand others); (ii) sugar alcohols (b-mannosylglycerate, myoinositol,\ngalactinol, 2-deoxyerythritol, ribitol, threitol and\ncellobitol); (iii) amino acids and derivatives (glutamine,\ntyrosine, glutamic acid, asparagine, aspartic acid, valine,\nphenylalanine, isoleucine, glycine, serine, proline, leucine,\ntryptophan, cysteine, methionine, citrulline, and others); (iv)\norganic acids (aconitic, allantoic, g-aminobutyric, azelaic, citric,\nfumaric, 2-furoic, D-glyceric, 3-hydroxypropionic, a-ketoadipic,\nmalic, methylmalonic, nicotinic, quinic, succinic, threonic);\nand (v) assorted metabolites including heterocyclic compounds,\nphenolics, and biogenic amines, etc (3-hydroxypyridine,\nmaleimide, noradrenaline, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoate,\n5-methoxytryptamine, uracil, aminomalonic acid, palmitic acid,\nand urea). Results of the analysis also revealed that root exudates\nof B. distachyon contain hydroxyectoine and the quaternary\namine (QA) glycine betaine (Supplementary Figure 1).\nPhylogenetic and Pangenome Analyses\nof Pseudomonas Strains Used in the\nStudy\nWe used a set of phylogenetic markers suggested by Mulet et al.\n(2010) to investigate the relatedness of the eight strains used in\nthis study to distinct lineages recognized within the P. fluorescens\nspecies complex. The multilocus sequence analysis based on\nthe concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S\nrRNA), gyrB, rpoB, and rpoD identified R1-43-08 (along with\nstrains 2-79 and SBW25) as a member of the P. fluorescens\nsubgroup (Figure 1). The rest of the strains clustered closely with\nfour additional subgroups of the P. fluorescens complex, namely\nP. corrugata (strains Q2-87 and Q8r1-96), P. koreensis (Pf0-1),\nP. protegens (Pf-5), and P. chlororaphis (30–84). The genomes of\nthe eight rhizosphere Pseudomonas strains varied in size by 1.43\nmegabase (ranging from 5.65 to 7.07 Mb) and contained between\n5,166 and 6,363 protein-coding genes (Figure 2A). The shared\ngene content was characterized with OrthoMCL, which uses allagainst-\nall BLASTp followed by the Markov Cluster algorithm to\nidentify protein groups shared between the compared genomes,\nas well as groups representing species-specific gene expansion\nfamilies (Li et al., 2003). The pangenome analysis revealed a\ncore comprised of approximately 3,179 orthologs that were\nshared among all strains and represented 50.0% to 61.5%\nof each predicted proteome (Figures 2A,B). The non-core\npangenome contained genes shared by two or more (but not\nall) strains and contained between 1,482 and 2,080 orthologs,\nwhich corresponded to 28.7–36.3% of individual proteomes. The\nrest of the predicted protein-coding genes were strain-specific\nsingletons that comprised 7.5% to 15.1% of the strain’s predicted\nproteomes. In respect to divergence from the core genome, strain\nPf-5 was found to possess the highest proportion of unique genes\n(n = 949) followed by 2-79 (n = 887). The entire pangenome of\nthe Pseudomonas strains encompassed over 12,000 homolog and\nsingleton gene families.\nFurther homolog family-based comparisons identified Q8r1-\n96 and R1-43-08 as the most distantly related strains, with\n3349 shared homologs (Supplementary Table 4A). Q8r1-96 and\nQ2-87, which shared 4,489 homologs, were the most closely\nrelated strains. The partitioning of homolog gene families into\nthe core, non-core, and singleton parts of the pangenome agreed\nwith phylogenetic relationships of the strains deduced from the\nanalysis of a selected subset of COGs (Clusters of Orthologous\nGroups) (Figure 2C and Supplementary Tables 4B,C). The\nCOG-based phylogeny supported the multilocus sequence\nanalysis and revealed that the eight Pseudomonas strains form\nthree distinct clusters, the first of which contained 2-79, R1-30-\n84, and SBW25. The second cluster included Q8r1-96 and Q2-87,\nwhereas the third encompassed strains 30-84, Pf-5, and Pf0-1.\nCorrelating the Composition of Root\nExudates With Metabolic Profiles of\nPseudomonas Strains\nWe used the Phenotype MicroArray PM1 and PM2 plates to\nprofile the eight Pseudomonas strains for the utilization of\n190 different carbon sources. Results of the analysis identified\n90 compounds that supported growth and clustered by their\nintensities of utilization into three distinct groups (Figure 3).\nGroup I was comprised of 30 highly metabolized carbon\nsources, which included several amino acids and intermediates of\nglycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, and citrate cycle. Approximately\nhalf of these compounds were catabolized by all eight strains,\nand included several organic acids (fumaric, citric, gluconic,\nmalic, and pyroglutamic), amino acids (Glu, Asn, Gln, Asp, Pro,\nAla, and g-aminobutyric acid), carbohydrates (glucose, mannose,\nand mannitol), and the purine nucleoside inosine. Group II\nwas composed of 44 chemically diverse carbon sources that\nwere variably utilized by the strains. These compounds were\ncarbohydrates, organic acids, amino acids, phenolics, and polyols,\nand included known compatible solutes and intermediates of\nmetabolism of pentoses, galactose, starch, and sucrose. Group\nIII encompassed the rest of the Phenotype MicroArray test\npanel and contained compounds that were not catabolized\nby the tested strains. Among several notable exceptions were\na-hydroxyglutamic acid- g-lactone, putrescine, and itaconic,\ncitramalic, and succinamic acids, which supported the growth\nof strains 2-79, 30-84, Pf-5, and SBW25.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nFIGURE 1 | Neighbor joining phylogeny showing the relationship of the eight strains used in this study (indicated by red triangles) to different species of the\nP. fluorescens complex. The phylogeny was established based on the concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S rRNA), gyrB (subunit B of DNA\ngyrase), rpoB (b subunit of RNA polymerase), and rpoD (sigma 70 factor subunit of RNA polymerase).

Interestingly, many carbon sources from\nthe Phenotype MicroArray panel were also present in the root\nexudates of B. distachyon Bd21, and some of these compounds\n(glucose, mannose, galactose, fructose, g-aminobutyric acid,\naspartic acid, citric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, quinic acid,\nalanine, glutamine, and glutamic acid) were catabolized by all\nstrains used in this study, while others (e.g., xylose, trehalose,\nm-inositol) were actively utilized only by certain organisms\n(Figure 3). The comparison of catabolic profiles across the\neight studied Pseudomonas strains revealed the presence of three\ndistinct clusters. The first cluster contained strains Q8r1-96 and\nQ2-87, which consumed very similar sets of carbon sources,\nas well as strain Pf0-1. The second cluster was composed of\n2-79, R1-43-08, SBW25, and 30-84, whereas the third cluster\nwas represented by a single strain, Pf-5. The overall similarity\nof the catabolic profiles partially agreed with the separation\nof the strains into different subgroups of the P. fluorescens\ncomplex (see above).\nAnalysis of the RNA-seq Results\nIn order to understand the cellular responses of rhizosphere\nPseudomonas to plant exometabolites, we analyzed the\ntranscriptome changes in cultures grown in the presence of\nroot exudates. Under field conditions, rhizobacteria colonize\nplant roots in the form of surface-attached microaerobic biofilms\n(Hojberg et al., 1999). To mimic these conditions, the eight\nPseudomonas strains were grown statically at 72% air saturation\nin 21C-glucose medium amended with root exudates and then\nprocessed to extract total RNA (Supplementary Figure 2).\nA total of 995 million raw sequencing reads were generated from\nthe RNA samples by using the Illumina HiSeq-2500 platform,\naveraging 20.7 million reads per sample. The removal of lowquality\nand rRNA sequences resulted in a total of 793 million\nfiltered reads that were mapped onto the eight Pseudomonas\ngenomes with a mean of 7.48 million mapped fragments per\ngenome. The differentially abundant transcripts were identified\nby setting a p value of 0.05 (adjusted for multiple testing) and\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 6 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

Box plots indicate the\n25th and 75th percentiles and medians (horizontal lines) with whiskers corresponding to the 10th and 90th percentiles. The input order was randomized to avoid any\nbias due to the sequential addition of new genomes. The pangenome size increases steadily without reaching a plateau even after the addition of 11,939\nnon-redundant gene families. At the same time, the core genome converged to 3,179 genes. (C) The pangenome-based phylogenomic analysis of the studied\nstrains. Here, the pangenome was defined with OrthoMCL, and orthologous gene sets were then partitioned into the core, singleton, and non-core (the remaining\northolog sets) categories. These categories were calculated for each node in the Maximum Likelihood species tree, using the set of genomes for which that node\nrepresents the ancestor. The results of the ortholog partitioning are shown in pie charts placed at tree nodes. Numbers indicate bootstrap support values. The\nanalysis was conducted in KBase (Arkin et al., 2018).\nthe log2 fold-change (FC) threshold \u2000\u2000 2.0 (Figure 4 and\nSupplementary Tables 5–12). When compared with the control\nconditions, an average of 204 genes per strain were differentially\nexpressed in the presence of root exudates, with the highest\n(n = 425) and lowest (n = 112) numbers observed, respectively,\nin SBW25 and Q2-87 (Figure 4). Overall, more genes were\ninduced than repressed in response to exudates, but the actual\nnumbers in each category varied substantially depending on the\nidentity of the Pseudomonas strain. In most strains, the bulk of\nthe differentially expressed genes was almost equally distributed\nbetween the core (mean, 48.2%) and non-core (mean, 45.8%)\nparts of the genome, whereas the strain-specific singleton genes\nconstituted on average only 5.9% (Figure 4B). One notable\nexception was observed in Q8r1-96, where all differentially\nexpressed genes belonged to the core (73.8%) and non-core\n(26.2%) parts of the genome. Another notable pattern was\nobserved in R1-43-08, where the majority of genes affected by\nthe presence of root exudate fell into the non-core category\n(56.3%). The highest proportion of differentially expressed\nsingletons (11.3 and 10.4%, respectively) was identified in\nstrains SBW25 and Pf-5.\nWe further explored how the identified differentially\nexpressed genes were distributed across genomes of the eight\nstudied rhizosphere strains. The pairwise BLASTp comparisons\nidentified 2-79 and SBW25 as two strains that shared the highest\nnumber of genes (n = 101) induced or repressed in response\nto root exudates (Table 1). The second pair of strains with\na significant number of similar differentially expressed genes\n(n = 86) was Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, which was followed by Pf0-1\nand 30-84, which shared 56 differentially expressed genes. These\npatterns of shared genes were also observed when the results of\nthe pairwise BLASTp comparisons were converted into a binary\ngene presence/absence matrix, which was then subjected to\ncluster analysis using a UPGMA algorithm based on Sorensen’s\ndissimilarity index or examined by non-metric multidimensional\nscaling (NMDS) (Figure 5).\nThe differentially expressed Pseudomonas genes were\nsubjected to Blast2Go analysis and Gene Ontology (GO)\nannotation (Figure 6). Metabolic process, catalytic activity,\nand membrane were the most common annotation terms\nacross the three primary GO term categories (i.e., biological\nprocess, molecular function, and cellular component). A total\nof 1,694 GO terms was assigned to 805 upregulated genes, with\nthe majority of the GO terms related to molecular function\n(682, 40.3%), followed by biological process (669, 39.5%), and\ncellular component (343, 20.2%). In the 539 downregulated gene\ncategory, 1,101 GO terms were assigned to biological process\n(420, 38.1%), molecular function (417, 37.9%), and cellular\ncomponent (264, 24.0%). Within biological process, metabolic\nprocess, cellular process, localization, response to stimulus, and\nregulation were over-represented. Within molecular function,\nthe largest proportion was assigned to catalytic activity, binding,\nand transporter activity categories. Within cellular component,\nthe majority were assigned to membrane, membrane part, cell,\nand cell part categories. Across the eight strains, 37–42% of\ndifferentially expressed genes had no Gene Ontology IDs and\nencoded various conserved hypothetical proteins.\nFunctional Classification of Shared\nDifferentially Expressed Genes\nThe interrogation of RNA-seq data revealed multiple cellular\npathways that were differentially regulated in bacterial cultures\nincubated with root exudates (Supplementary Figures 3, 4).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 7 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nFIGURE 3 | Biolog Phenotype MicroArray profiling the eight rhizosphere\nPseudomonas strains used in the study. The hierarchical clustering analysis\nwas carried out using the average linkage method with Euclidean distances.\nCarbon sources identified by red arrowheads were also detected in the sterile\nroot exudates of B. distachyon Bd21.\nAlthough none of these differentially regulated pathways were\nshared by all eight strains, the cross-strain comparisons revealed\nseveral types of common and specific transcriptomic responses\nthat were elicited by the presence of plant exometabolites\n(Table 2). The visual representation of core gene expression\npatterns is provided in Supplementary Figure 5, which\nshows heatmaps of expression profiles and p-adj values for\ncore genes shared by the studied strains. The figure is\naccompanied by Supplementary Table 13 that lists predicted\nfunctions of genes constituting the four distinct clusters\nobserved after hierarchical clustering of gene expression\nvalues. The first category of shared differentially expressed\npathways functioned in the uptake and catabolism of selected\ncarbohydrates, quaternary ammonium compounds (QAs), and\nphenolics. All strains except for R1-43-08, responded to root\nexudates by inducing the fructose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate\n(PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTSFru). The\ncomponents of this system are encoded by a conserved\noperon and include the cytoplasmic polyprotein EI/HPr/EIIAFru\n(FruB), the 1-phosphofructokinase FruK, and the fructosespecific\npermease EIIBC (FruA) (Chavarria et al., 2016). The\nPTSFru system functions by acquiring high-energy phosphates\nfrom PEP and sequentially passing them, via the EI/HPr/EIIAFru\ndomains of FruB, to the EIIB component of FruA. The\nphosphates are ultimately transferred by the EIIC transporter\nto fructose yielding fructose 1-phosphate, which is channeled\ninto the central metabolic pathways through the action of the\nphosphofructokinase FruK.\nIn all strains except for Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, the exposure to root\nexudates resulted in the induction of two genes adjacent to the\nfru cluster that encoded a Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS)\ntransporter and an L-arabinonate dehydratase (Table 2). These\ngenes are predicted to participate in the uptake and catabolism\nof L-arabinose, where L-arabinonate dehydratase plays an\nimportant role by converting L-arabinonate to 2-dehydro-3-\ndeoxy-L-arabinonate (Rahman et al., 2017). In SBW25, R1-\n43-08, and Q2-87, we also observed the induction of genes\nencoding components of the AraFGH complex, an ATP-Binding\nCassette (ABC) superfamily transporter involved in the import of\narabinose into the cell (Supplementary Tables 6, 7, 9). Finally, all\nstrains except SBW25 and R1-43-08 responded to the presence\nof exudates by upregulating a conserved gene encoding an\naldose epimerase superfamily protein. Such enzymes equilibrate\nalpha- and beta-anomers of aldoses and ensure that stereospecific\nenzymes involved in the metabolism of free sugars do not act as\nmetabolic bottlenecks (Abayakoon et al., 2018). Although some\naldose epimerases have been linked to specific pathways, the\nPseudomonas gene identified in this study could not be assigned\nto a particular metabolic process based on sequence analysis and\ngenomic location.\nSeveral Pseudomonas strains responded to the presence\nof root exudates by upregulating genes involved in the\nuptake and catabolism of myo-inositol and possibly other\nstereoisomers of inositol (Table 2). The upregulated catabolic\ngenes encode the dehydrogenase IolG, which oxidizes myoinositol\nto its corresponding ketone, as well as IolE, IolD, IolB,\nand IolC that collectively convert the 2-keto-myo-inositol to\nacetyl-CoA and the glycolysis intermediate dihydroxyacetone\nphosphate (Yoshida et al., 2008; Kohler et al., 2011).

The cross-genome comparisons revealed\nthat in all studied strains except for Pf0-1, components\nof the myo-inositol utilization pathway were encoded\nwithin a well-conserved gene cluster which, in addition to\ncatabolic and transport functions, also encodes a dedicated\ntranscriptional repressor.\nAll studied strains of Pseudomonas carry multiple genes\ninvolved in scavenging the quaternary ammonium compounds\ncholine, glycine betaine (GB), carnitine, choline-O-sulfate, and\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 9 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

Many of these genes were\ndifferentially expressed, including those encoding parts of the\nABC transporter CbcXWV, which is predicted to function in\nthe uptake of choline under water-replete conditions (Table 2).\nAmong enzymes induced in the presence of root exudates were\nthe choline dehydrogenase BetA, which converts choline to\nglycine betaine and a network of enzymes (i.e., the Rieske family\noxygenase GbcAB, the dimethyglycine demethylase DgcAB, and\nthe sarcosine oxidase SoxBDAG) that sequentially convert GB\nto glycine. In 2-79 and SBW25, this group of differentially\nregulated genes also included an AraC-family transcriptional\nactivator GbdR, which perceives intercellular levels of GB and\ninduces genes involved in the transport and catabolism of\nglycine betaine and detoxification of the catabolic byproducts\n(Hampel et al., 2014).\nThe last category of activated catabolic pathways included the\ncatechol branch of the b-ketoadipate pathway for the degradation\nof aromatic compounds. In strains 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5,\ngrowth on root exudates resulted in upregulation of catechol-\n1,2-dioxygenase, muconate cycloisomerase, and muconolactone\nisomerase, which collectively cleave the catechol ring and\nconvert it to b-ketoadipate enol-lactone (Harwood and Parales,\n1996). Finally, analysis of the P. synxantha 2-79 transcriptome\nidentified an induction of benABC genes encoding subunits\nof benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase, an oxidoreductase that generates\ncatechol from benzoate.\nIn addition to various catabolic pathways, the exposure to root\nexudates also induced several genes involved in the homeostasis\nof copper (Table 2). Four of these genes form a conserved cluster\nin genomes of the strains and encode the periplasmic coppersensing\ntwo-component system CinRS, the plastocyanin/azurinlike\nprotein CinA, and the NADPH-dependent pre-Q0 reductase\nCinQ. Also, in strains Q2-87, 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, we observed\nupregulation of a conserved operon encoding the multicopper\noxidase CopA, the periplasmic copper-binding protein CopC, the\ninner membrane protein CopD, and outer membrane protein\nCopB. In several Gram-negative bacteria, these Cop proteins are\nthought to have dual functions and participate both in the uptake\nof essential copper as well as in the sequestration of excess copper\nin the periplasm and outer membrane.\nThe analysis of shared downregulated pathways revealed that\nmost of the strains respond to the presence of root exudates by\nrepressing genes involved in the uptake and catabolism of sulfur\ncompounds (Table 2). In strains SBW25, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96,\nQ2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, this response involved the ssuEADCB\noperon responsible for the utilization of alkanesulfonates\nas sulfur sources. The ssu operon is highly conserved in\nfluorescent pseudomonads and encodes the FMNH2-dependent\nmonooxygenase SsuD and the NAD (P)H-dependent FMN\nreductase SsuE, which together catalyze the desulfonation of\nalkanesulfonates. Also, the ssu locus contains genes for the\nmolybdopterin-binding protein SsuF and the alkanesulfonatespecific\nABC-type transporter consisting of the sulfonate\nsubstrate-binding protein SsuA, sulfonate permease protein\nSsuC, and sulfonate transport ATP-binding protein SsuB. Finally,\nin R1-43-08, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, growth on root exudates\ncoincided with repression of the tauABCD operon, which\nallows these strains to utilize taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonate)\nas a sulfur source. The repressed tau genes encoded the\n2-oxoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenase TauD and\nsubstrate-binding, ATP-binding, and permease components of\nthe taurine-specific ABC transporter TauABC.\nOther Differentially Expressed Pathways\nIn addition to their effect on several shared cellular pathways,\ngrowth on root exudates resulted in the induction or repression of\nnumerous strain-specific genes. In closely related P. synxantha 2-\n79 and P. fluorescens SBW25, we observed differential expression\nof genes involved in energy metabolism, transport of amino\nacids, and surface attachment (Supplementary Tables 5, 6).\nOther notable differentially expressed pathways included 2–\n79 gene clusters that encode enzymes for the catabolism of\ntrehalose, a prophage, and toxin/antitoxin system, as well as the\nSBW25 operon predicted to control the synthesis of the capsular\nexopolysaccharide colonic acid. The response of Pseudomonas sp.\nR1-43-08 to root exudates also involved differential expression\nof different energy metabolism pathways. In addition, we\nobserved the upregulation of genes involved in the uptake and\ncatabolism of xylose (also upregulated in 2–79) and repression\nof enzymes for the biosynthesis of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid\nand assimilation of inorganic sulfur and L-cysteine biosynthesis\n(Supplementary Table 7).\nThe analysis of the Q8r1-96 transcriptome revealed\nperturbation of different metabolic pathways including genes\nencoding components of cytochrome C oxidase, transport\nand catabolism of sorbitol/mannitol, metabolism of butanoic\nacid, and biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides alginate and\npoly-b-1-6-N-acetylglucosamine (Supplementary Table 8). In\nP. fluorescens Q2-87, we identified differential expression of\ngenes involved in metabolism of galactose, tryptophan, tyrosine,\nglycine, serine, and threonine (Supplementary Table 9),\nwhile in P. chlororaphis 30-84, growth on exudates activated\nthe biosynthesis of molybdopterin cofactor, catabolism of\ngalactonate and acetoin, and uptake and catabolism of putrescine\n(Supplementary Table 10).

The differentially expressed genes of\nP. fluorescens Pf0-1 included, among others, operons encoding\ncytochrome C oxidase and enzymes for catabolism of malonic\nacid (Supplementary Table 12). Yet another interesting\nfinding involved the induction of assorted genes acting in the\nhomeostasis of iron and defense against reactive oxygen species\n(ROS). We observed activation of iron dicitrate transporters\n(SBW25 and 30-84), genes for the biosynthesis of siderophores\nornicorrugatin (SBW25) and pyochelin (Pf-5), heme-degrading\nenzymes (2–79, 30–84), TonB siderophore receptors, and\ncomponents of the energy-transducing inner membrane\ncomplex TonB-ExbB-ExbD (2–79 and Pf-5).

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nsoil microorganisms. Our results were in agreement with a\nrecent report of 27 different sugars, amino acids, and organic\nacids in Brachypodium exudates (Kawasaki et al., 2016). We\nconfirmed the presence of exometabolites identified in that\nstudy, along with dozens of additional analytes that were\nidentified by matching their mass-spectra and retention indices\nto the LECO/Fiehn Metabolomics library (Supplementary\nTable 3). The complementation of the metabolomic analysis\nwith profiling of the bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays\nrevealed that a substantial proportion of the characterized\nexudate constituents were catabolized by a collection of eight\nPseudomonas strains from across the P. fluorescens group that is\nknown to form associations with plant roots. The amendment\nof Pseudomonas cultures with root exudates caused changes in\nthe expression of multiple genes encoding catabolic and anabolic\nenzymes, predicted transporters, transcriptional regulators, stress\nresponse, and conserved hypothetical proteins. In most strains,\nthese differentially expressed genes were almost equally split\nbetween the core and variable genome regions, mirroring\nthe substantial strain-to-strain variation in the genome size\nand gene content within the P. fluorescens species complex\n(Loper et al., 2012).\nThe analysis of transcriptome responses to root exudates\nrevealed several types of cellular pathways present in the strains\nused in this study. The first category of such pathways was\ninvolved in the catabolism of carbohydrates such as fructose,\narabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, trehalose, and galactose. Among\nthese catabolic traits, the ability to utilize fructose as a carbon\nsource is highly conserved among fluorescent pseudomonads.\nIn contrast, growth on arabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, and\ntrehalose is variably present and was traditionally used to\ndifferentiate species and biovars within the P. fluorescens\ngroup (Barrett et al., 1986). We speculate that such variably\ndistributed pathways contribute to the differential affinity of\npseudomonads toward host plants and/or to determine which\nstrains flourish in response to growing roots and changing\nenvironments. Several independent studies have confirmed\nthe importance of carbohydrate catabolism pathways for the\nbiology of rhizosphere pseudomonads. For example, in vivo\nexpression technology (IVET) profiling of P. fluorescens SBW25\nidentified xylose isomerase among genome regions essential\nfor the colonization of sugar beet seedlings (Liu et al., 2015),\nwhereas a genome-wide Tn-Seq screen of Pseudomonas simiae\nidentified genes for the catabolism of myo-inositol among traits\nessential for the colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana roots\n(Cole et al., 2017).\nThe response of rhizosphere Pseudomonas to Brachypodium\nroot exudates also involved pathways for the uptake and\nmetabolism of amino acids. We observed differential\nexpression of genes encoding the hydrophobic (HAAT) and\npolar (PAAT) amino acid uptake transporters in strains\n2-79, SBW25, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5. Other related genes\nencoded enzymes for the catabolism of valine and glutamic\nacid (2-79); metabolism of tryptophan, glycine, serine, and\nthreonine (Q2-87); and biosynthesis of methionine (Q8r1-\n96). It is plausible that the abundance of amino acids in\nroot exudates is also linked to the repression of pathways\ninvolved in the catabolism of sulfonates and taurine that\nwas observed in several strains (Table 2). Although the\npreferred source of sulfur for P. fluorescens is unknown, in the\nclosely related P. aeruginosa, the sulfur starvation response\nis triggered by the growth on any sulfur compound other\nthan sulfate, thiocyanate, and cysteine (Hummerjohann et al.,\n1998). This fact, together with the presence of cysteine and\ncystine in the root exudates, suggest that root exudates of\nBrachypodium may serve as an important source of sulfur for\nrhizosphere Pseudomonas. These findings also agree well with\nthe reported scarcity of inorganic sulfate in the soil, and the\npresence of sulfur mostly in the form of organic compounds,\nincluding amino acids, proteins, sulfate esters, and sulfonates\n(Autry and Fitzgerald, 1990).\nAnother interesting result of this study was the concerted\nactivation of copper and iron homeostasis pathways observed\nin all of the Pseudomonas strains used in this work. In bacteria,\nan excess of copper is toxic and triggers oxidative stress due to\nthe formation of free radicals, as well as disruption of protein\nmetalation and stability of iron-sulfur clusters (Bondarczuk\nand Piotrowska-Seget, 2013). On the other hand, copper is an\nessential trace element used as a cofactor in different enzymes.\nSimilarly, although elevated levels of iron cause redox stress, this\nelement is also found in active energy metabolism enzymes and is\ncrucial for bacterial growth (Andrews et al., 2003). The analysis\nof metal homeostasis genes identified in this study suggests\nthat their induction was likely triggered by the deficiency of\ncopper and iron in bacterial cultures grown in the presence of\nroot exudates. We attribute this effect to the ability of some\ncomponents of root exudates to chelate soil metals.\nDespite the abundance of iron in the soil, its bioavailability\nis limited due to the low solubility of Fe (III) oxyhydrates\nat neutral pH. The non-graminaceous plants circumvent this\nproblem by acidifying the rhizosphere and secreting flavins,\nphenolics, and organic acids that chelate iron. The reduction\nof these ferric chelates releases soluble ferrous iron taken up\nby root cells (Kobayashi and Nishizawa, 2012). Graminaceous\nplants, like Brachypodium, acquire iron by secreting into the\nsoil non-protein amino acids of the mugineic acid (MA) group,\nwhich act as Fe (III)-chelating phytosiderophores. In addition to\niron, low-molecular-weight organic acids and phytosiderophores\nbind other divalent and trivalent metals (including copper) and\ncontribute to heavy-metal tolerance in plants (Chen et al., 2017).\nIt is plausible that the presence of these plant exometabolites\nis responsible for the deficit of iron and copper observed in\nPseudomonas cultures grown in the presence of root exudates.\nThese results further underscore the importance of diverse and\nredundant metal homeostasis pathways found in genomes of the\nP. fluorescens group for the ability of these organisms to colonize\nand persist in the plant rhizosphere.\nRecently, Klonowska et al. (2018) examined transcriptomic\nresponses of symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria to root\nexudates of the legume plant Mimosa pundica, which has\nan unusual ability to support both alpha- (Rhizobium) and\nbeta-rhizobia (Cupriavidus and Burkholderia). Using RNA-seq,\nthe authors characterized genes involved in the perception of\nroot exudates in the nodulating bacteria Burkholderia phymatum\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 14 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nSTM815, Cupriavidus taiwanensis LMG19424, and Rhizobium\nmesoamericanum STM3625. Interestingly, the analysis of\ndifferentially expressed genes revealed induction of pathways\ninvolved in the catabolism of fructose, xylose, myo-inositol,\nand protocatechuate/catechol. Also upregulated were some\ncopper homeostasis, siderophore biosynthesis, and oxidative\nstress genes. Finally, the analytical profiling of M. pundica\nexudates revealed an overlap with Brachypodium in the types of\ncarbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids present. These\nfindings suggest that differentially expressed genes shared by\nmultiple strains of the group P. fluorescens are not unique to\nthe Brachypodium-Pseudomonas system but represent a set\nof conserved cellular pathways involved in the perception of\nplant exometabolites by different clades of rhizosphere-dwelling\nProteobacteria.\nMost strains included in this study were originally selected\nbased on the ability to colonize the rhizosphere and produce\nsecondary metabolites that alleviate the plant stress response\nand/or inhibit soilborne pathogens. It has been suggested\nthat plant metabolites released into the rhizosphere affect\nthe biocontrol activity of plant-beneficial pseudomonads (de\nWerra et al., 2011). We provide further support to this\nhypothesis by demonstrating that in some strains, root exudates\nmodulate the expression of genes for the catabolism of\nthe plant growth-promoting metabolites acetoin and 2,3-\nbutanediol. The exposure to exudates also affected the expression\nof genes for the synthesis of well-characterized antifungal\ncompounds pyrrolnitrin, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, and 2,4-\ndiacetylphloroglucinol. The modulatory effects were strainspecific,\nsuggesting significant differences in the regulatory\nnetworks involved in the perception of plant signals and\nregulation of the production of antibiotics and growthpromoting\nmetabolites.\nThe final significant finding of this study was the induction\nof catabolism of quaternary amines (QAs) observed in multiple\nstrains of the P. fluorescens group during growth on root\nexudates. This observation was supported by the detection of\nglycine betaine in the root secretions of B. distachyon. The\npresence of QAs in plant tissues and the capacity of these\nmetabolites to provide stress protection and nutrients to plant\npathogens and symbionts were reported before (Boncompagni\net al., 1999; Chen et al., 2013; Kabbadj et al., 2017), but our\nstudy is among the first to highlight the potential importance of\nthese metabolites for rhizosphere interactions. Pseudomonads do\nnot synthesize QAs de novo but have evolved many pathways to\nscavenge them from eukaryotic hosts, where these metabolites\nare abundant due to the prominence of phosphatidylcholine\nin cellular membranes. Strains of P. fluorescens carry genes\nfor the conversion of choline, carnitine, and glycine betaine to\nglycine, as well as quaternary amine transporters of the BCCT\nand ABC families that are also conserved in the opportunistic\nhuman pathogen P. aeruginosa and the plant pathogen P. syringae\n(Galvao et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2013; Wargo, 2013b).\nIn P. aeruginosa, choline catabolism genes are essential for\nthe ability of this pathogen to persist during lung infection\n(Wargo, 2013a). Similarly, a P. syringae mutant deficient in\nBetT, OpuC, and CbcXWV quaternary amine transporters had\nreduced fitness during colonization of bean and soybean leaves\nunder greenhouse and field conditions (Chen et al., 2013).\nDepending on water availability, P. aeruginosa and P. syringae\ncatabolize exogenously supplied QAs as carbon and nitrogen\nsources or accumulate them as osmoprotectants (Chen et al.,\n2013; Wargo, 2013b). Our ongoing work in P. synxantha 2–\n79 unraveled similar physiological responses and demonstrated\nthat QA transporters function differentially and redundantly\nin the uptake of quaternary amines as nutrients (Pablo and\nMavrodi, unpublished). In contrast, under water stress, the QAs\ncholine, betaine, and carnitine are accumulated preferentially for\nosmoprotection. Under drought stress, a 2–79 mutant devoid\nof all known QA transporters was less competitive in the\ncolonization of the Brachypodium rhizosphere than its wild-type\nparental strain. Interestingly, our metabolomic profiling of root\nexudates also revealed proline, glutamine, and hydroxyectoine.\nThese metabolites act as compatible solutes in different groups\nof microorganisms (Yancey et al., 1982; Empadinhas and da\nCosta, 2008), suggesting an important role of root exudates\nin the ability of Pseudomonas to persist in the rhizosphere of\ndrought-stressed plants.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe original contributions presented in the study are publicly\navailable.

Plant roots secrete carbon-rich rhizodeposits containing primary and\nsecondary low molecular weight metabolites, lysates, and mucilages. These exudates\nprovide nutrients for soil microorganisms and modulate their affinity to host plants, but\nmolecular details of this process are largely unresolved. We addressed this gap by\nfocusing on the molecular dialog between eight well-characterized beneficial strains\nof the Pseudomonas fluorescens group and Brachypodium distachyon, a model for\neconomically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops of the grass family. We\ncollected and analyzed root exudates of B. distachyon and demonstrated the presence\nof multiple carbohydrates, amino acids, organic acids, and phenolic compounds. The\nsubsequent screening of bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays revealed that many\nof these metabolites provide carbon and energy for the Pseudomonas strains. RNAseq\nprofiling of bacterial cultures amended with root exudates revealed changes in the\nexpression of genes encoding numerous catabolic and anabolic enzymes, transporters,\ntranscriptional regulators, stress response, and conserved hypothetical proteins. Almost\nhalf of the differentially expressed genes mapped to the variable part of the strains’\npangenome, reflecting the importance of the variable gene content in the adaptation of\nP. fluorescens to the rhizosphere lifestyle.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nINTRODUCTION\nPlants are meta-organisms or holobionts that rely in part on\ntheir microbiome for specific functions and traits. The ability\nof the plant microbiome to influence plant development, vigor,\nhealth, and fitness in response to abiotic stressors associated\nwith global climate change is documented by numerous studies\n(Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009). There is mounting evidence\nthat plants actively recruit beneficial microbiomes, but many\naspects of this process are still very much a black box (Reinhold-\nHurek et al., 2015). The foundation for the differential affinity\nof rhizobacteria toward host plants is built upon complex\nchemical cross talk between microorganisms and plant roots.\nUp to 40% of photosynthetically fixed carbon is released by\nplant roots in the form of exudates and secretions, lysates, and\nmucilages (Curl and Truelove, 1986; Lynch, 1990; Whipps, 1990;\nBadri and Vivanco, 2009). The release of these compounds is\nactively controlled in response to environmental stimuli, and the\ncomposition of root exudates varies greatly according to plant\nspecies and physiological condition (Lynch, 1990; Nguyen, 2003;\nPhillips et al., 2004; De-la-Pena et al., 2008). The presence and\ncomposition of exudates strongly impact soil microorganisms,\nwhich is consistent with the idea that plants actively select and\nshape their root microbiota (Zolla et al., 2013).\nPrimary root exudates include simple and complex sugars,\namino acids, polypeptides and proteins, organic, aliphatic and\nfatty acids, sterols, and phenolics (Nguyen, 2003; Badri and\nVivanco, 2009; Badri et al., 2009). These compounds serve as\ncarbon and energy sources for rhizobacteria, and the presence\nof the intact corresponding catabolic pathways is essential\nfor competitive colonization of roots and disease suppression\n(Lugtenberg et al., 2001; Kamilova et al., 2005; Lugtenberg and\nKamilova, 2009). Root exudates also contain numerous signal\nmolecules and secondary metabolites, the significance of which\nis only now emerging (Walker et al., 2003; Bais et al., 2005,\n2006). A handful of analyses of plant-induced gene expression\nby transcriptional profiling in vitro (Mark et al., 2005) or in\nthe rhizosphere (Silby and Levy, 2004; Ramos-Gonzalez et al.,\n2005; Matilla et al., 2007; Barret et al., 2009) have identified\nmultiple genes that are differentially regulated by exposure to\nroots or root exudates. Bacterial pathways expressed during\nrhizosphere colonization control utilization of plant-derived\nmetabolites (Simons et al., 1996, 1997; Camacho-Carvajal, 2001;\nLugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), motility and chemotaxis (de\nWeert et al., 2002; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), phase\nvariation (Dekkers et al., 1998; Sanchez-Contreras et al., 2002;\nvan den Broek et al., 2005), outer membrane integrity (de Weert\net al., 2006; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), and the ability\nto sequester limiting resources (Raaijmakers et al., 1995) and\nresist environmental stresses (Sarniguet et al., 1995; Miller and\nWood, 1996; van Veen et al., 1997; Schnider-Keel et al., 2001). In\nits spatial and temporal properties, root colonization resembles\nbiofilm formation, and biofilm-related pathways also have been\nimplicated in adhesion to seeds and roots and rhizosphere\ncolonization (Espinosa-Urgel et al., 2000; Hinsa et al., 2003;\nYousef-Coronado et al., 2008; Fuqua, 2010; Martinez-Gil et al.,\n2010; Nielsen et al., 2011; Zboralski and Filion, 2020). Finally,\nroot exudates strongly affect the expression of diverse plant\ngrowth promotion and biocontrol genes (Vacheron et al., 2013).\nOver the past decade, the genomes of numerous rhizosphere\nstrains have been sequenced and analyzed, but functional\ngenomics studies of rhizosphere competence lag behind the\navailability of sequence data.\nThis study explored the molecular dialog between the\nmodel host plant Brachypodium distachyon and several wellcharacterized\nrhizosphere strains of the Pseudomonas fluorescens\ngroup. Brachypodium is a small annual grass originating in semiarid\nregions of the Middle East that has emerged as a prime model\nfor economically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops\nof the grass family (Bevan et al., 2010; Schwartz et al., 2010;\nBrkljacic et al., 2011; Hong et al., 2011; Tyler et al., 2014). The\nbiology, extensive collection of resources, and research tools\nmake B. distachyon an attractive model to investigate interactions\nbetween plants and root-associated microbes. Pseudomonads\nare ubiquitous Gram-negative g-proteobacteria that colonize\neukaryotic hosts and include both commensals and economically\nimportant pathogens of plants and animals (Moore et al.,\n2006; Schroth et al., 2006; Yahr and Parsek, 2006). The genus\nPseudomonas currently comprises > 100 named species that have\nbeen separated based on multilocus sequence analysis into 14\nspecies groups (Garrido-Sanz et al., 2016; Hesse et al., 2018).\nThe P. fluorescens group is the most diverse regarding both\nthe genetic distances within it, the number of species and the\nlarge pangenome that makes up > 50% of the pangenome\nof the genus as a whole (Loper et al., 2012). The group also\nencompasses an unusually high proportion of strains that inhabit\nthe plant rhizosphere and possess plant growth promoting and\nbiocontrol properties. Naylor et al. (2017) profiled bacterial\ncommunities associated with root tissues and rhizosphere of\n18 different plant species of the Poaceae family. That study\nidentified Pseudomonas among taxa constituting the core grass\nroot microbiome and demonstrated that these bacteria were\nenriched in C3 plants, including wheat, rye, barley, oat, and\nBrachypodium. We confirmed the capacity of B. distachyon\nBd21 to serve as a host for rhizobacteria of the P. fluorescens\ngroup in preliminary greenhouse assays with biocontrol strains\nP. synxantha 2-79, P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96, and P. protegens\nPf-5. Results of these experiments revealed that all strains\nsuccessfully established and colonized the roots of Brachypodium\n(Supplementary Table 1).\nIn this study, we focused on eight well-studied strains\nof the P. fluorescens complex that are supported by years\nof studies, numerous refereed publications, and high-quality\ngenome sequences. By profiling transcriptomes of these strains\nduring growth in root exudates of B. distachyon, we revealed the\ndiversity of cellular pathways and physiological responses that\nunderlie the establishment of mutualistic interactions between\nbeneficial rhizobacteria and the host plant. Our results also\nconfirmed that root exudates contain carbohydrates, amino acids,\norganic acids, and phenolics that serve as carbon and energy\nsources for rhizobacteria. The root exudates also contained\nosmoprotectants that may help microorganisms to persist in the\nrhizosphere of drought-stressed plants.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nthe variable genome in adaptation of individual strains of\nPseudomonas to the rhizosphere lifestyle.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacterial Strains Used in the Study\nThe eight Pseudomonas strains used for this study are\nP. synxantha 2-79 (Thomashow and Weller, 1988), P. fluorescens\nSBW25 (Silby et al., 2009), Pseudomonas sp. R1-43-08 (Parejko\net al., 2012), P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96 (Raaijmakers and Weller,\n1998), P. fluorescens Q2-87 (Bangera and Thomashow, 1996),\nP. chlororaphis 30-84 (Thomashow et al., 1990), P. fluorescens\nPf0-1 (Silby et al., 2009), and P. protegens Pf-5 (Howell and\nStipanovic, 1980). The selected organisms have been studied\nextensively for their role in biological control and plant\ngrowth promotion (Supplementary Table 2). The strains were\nmaintained in the laboratory as frozen stocks (\U0010000080\u2000C) and\nroutinely cultured in King’s medium B (King et al., 1954) or\n21C medium, which contained (per 1 L): 1.0 g of NH4Cl, 3.5 g\nof Na2HPO4\u20002H2O, 2.8 g of KH2PO4, 3.0 g of glucose, and\n20 ml of a microelement solution (Smibert and Kreig, 1994;\nHalverson and Firestone, 2000).\nPropagation of Plants and Collection of\nRoot Exudates\nB. distachyon Bd21 was established from seed material obtained\nfrom the USDA-ARS Plant Germplasm Introduction and Testing\nResearch Unit (Pullman, WA, United States). Brachypodium\nseeds were imbibed for 3 days at 4\u2000C and sown in 7 \u2000 7 cm\npots filled with Sunshine Potting Mix #4 (Sun Gro Horticulture,\nAgawam, MA, United States). Plants were grown in an IR-\n89X (Percival Scientific, Perry, IA, United States) controlled\nenvironment chamber retrofitted with 6500K and 3000K T5 54W\ngrow lights (Spectralux) under a 20-h light, 24\u2000C/4-h dark, 18\u2000C\ncycle. Plants were watered and fertilized with Jack’s professional\nwater-soluble fertilizer (20:20:20) (JR Peters, Allentown, PA,\nUnited States). After 12 weeks and plant senescence, seeds\nwere collected, processed, and stored under desiccant and dark\nconditions at room temperature.\nTo collect root exudates, seeds of B. distachyon Bd21 were\nsurface-sterilized, pregerminated, and placed in sterile 1 L widemouth\nglass jars containing 113 g of 6-mm glass beads and\n25 ml distilled water. Jars were covered with vented caps\nand plants were grown hydroponically in an environmental\ncontrolled growth chamber under conditions described above.\nAfter 6 days, root exudates were extracted from individual\njars and their sterility was confirmed by spotting on nutrient\nagar. Multiple batches of root exudates were collected, filtered\n(0.22 mm), aliquoted in Falcon tubes (10 ml), lyophilized, and\nstored at –80\u2000C.\nMetabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates\nExudates were analyzed for primary metabolites at the Murdock\nMetabolomics Laboratory at Washington State University\n(Pullman, WA, United States). Freeze-dried residues were\nsuspended in 500 ml 50% aqueous acetonitrile and clarified by\ncentrifugation for 20 min at 21,000 \u2000 g and 4\u2000C. The liquid\nchromatography mass spectrometry analysis was conducted\nwith a Synapt G2-S quadrupole-ion mobility spectrometrytime\nof flight mass spectrometer system equipped with an\nacquity ultra-performance liquid chromatograph (UPLC) and\nan acquity photodiode array detector (all from Waters, Milford,\nMA, United States). The exudate metabolites were separated\non a SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC HPLC column (2.1 \u2000 100 mm,\n3 mm) (Milllipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, United States) using\nacetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid as solvent B and water\nwith 0.1% formic acid as solvent A at a flow rate of 400 ml\nmin\U001000001 and the following linear gradient extending over 14 min:\n0 min, 80% B; 4 min, 80% B, 6 min: 10% B; 7.5 min, 10%\nB; 10 min, 80% B; and 14 min, 80% B. Mass spectra were\ncollected in positive ion mode over a range of m/z 50–1,200\nwith a scan time of 0.2 s. The Q-TOF-MS source was at\n3.0 kV and 120\u2000C; the sampling cone at 40 V, desolvation\ntemperature was 250\u2000C; cone gas and desolvation gas flow were\nat 0 and 850 L h\U001000001, respectively. Leucine enkephalin was used\nfor post-acquisition mass correction. Target compounds were\nvisualized using selected ion chromatograms at 0.05 Da window\nwidth. The compound identification was based on comparison\nof chromatographic behavior and accurate masses to those of\nauthentic standards.\nFor gas chromatography, derivatization was carried out using\na modification of the procedure of Lee and Fiehn (2008).\nThe freeze-dried residues were suspended in 950 ml aqueous\nmethanol (84%, v/v) and clarified by centrifugation for 15 min\nat 21,000 \u2000 g at 4\u2000C. The supernatants were spiked with 1\nmg of the internal standard salicylic acid-d6 (C/D/N Isotopes,\nQuebec, Canada) and dried in vacuo. The dry residues were\nsuspended in 10 ml of O-methoxylamine hydrochloride (30 mg\nml\U001000001 in anhydrous pyridine, both from Millipore Sigma) and\nincubated while mixing (1,000 RPM) for 90 min at 30\u2000C.\nSubsequently, samples were derivatized with 90 ml of MSTFA\nwith 1% TMCS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,\nUnited States) for 30 min at 37\u2000C. Gas chromatography-mass\nspectroscopy analysis was performed using a Pegasus 4D timeof-\nflight mass spectrometer (LECO, Saint Joseph MI) equipped\nwith a MPS2 autosampler (Gerstel, Linthicum, MD) and a 7890A\noven (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States).\nThe derivatization products were separated on a 30-m, 0.25 mm\ni.d., 0.25 mm df Rxi-5Sil column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA,\nUnited States) with an IntegraGuard precolumn using ultrapure\nHe at a constant flow of 0.9 ml min\U001000001 as carrier gas. The linear\nthermal gradient started with a 1-min hold at 70\u2000C, followed\nby a ramp to 300\u2000C at 10\u2000C min\U001000001. The final temperature was\nheld for 5 min prior to returning to initial conditions. Mass\nspectra were collected at 17 spectra s\U001000001. Peak identification was\nconducted using the Fiehn primary metabolite library (Kind\net al., 2009) and an identity score cutoff of 700. Additionally,\nauthentic standards for a number of primary metabolites were\nanalyzed under identical conditions and the data used to compare\nthe chromatographic behavior. Peak alignment and spectrum\ncomparisons were carried out using the Statistical Compare\nfeature of ChromaTOF software (LECO).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 3 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nIsolation of RNA From Bacteria Cultured\nin Root Exudates and RNA-Seq\nThe strains were pregrown overnight at 25\u2000C on 21C-glucose\nagar and then subcultured into 96-well microplates containing\nliquid 21C-glucose medium amended with Brachypodium\nexudates. The liquid medium was prepared by dissolving the\nlyophilized root exudate material in an appropriate volume of\n21C-glucose medium to concentrate root exudates 20-fold. The\ngrowth medium was sterilized by passing it through a 0.22-\nmm membrane filter. The control cultures were grown under\nidentical conditions in the absence of exudates. All treatments\nwere inoculated at OD600 of 0.1 and incubated for 20 to\n22 h until cultures entered late-exponential growth phase at\n25\u2000C in an atmosphere of 15% oxygen [created by a ProOx\nP110 oxygen controller (BioSpherix, Parish, NY, United States)\nwith a hypoxia C-chamber]. The cells were stabilized by the\naddition RNAprotect reagent (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD,\nUnited States) and total RNA was purified using a RNeasy Protect\nBacteria Mini Kit (QIAGEN) from three biological replicates of\neach strain cultured under control conditions and in exudates.\nThe quality assessment of the extracted RNA samples was\nperformed with a NanoDrop OneC Spectrophotometer (Thermo\nFisher Scientific) and a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies)\nand revealed A260/A280 and A260/A230 values of > 2.0 and a mean\nRNA integrity numbers (RIN) value of > 9.2.\nThree biological replicates of RNA samples were shipped on\ndry ice to the DOE Joint Genome Institute (Walnut Creek, CA,\nUnited States), where rRNA was depleted and stranded RNASeq\nlibraries were prepared, quantified by qPCR and sequenced\nusing a HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina). The fastq file reads\nwere filtered and processed with BBDuk1 to remove reads that\ncontained 1 or more “N” bases, had an average quality score\nacross the read less than 10 or had a minimum length < 51 bp\nor 33% of the full read length. Reads mapped with BBMap (see\ntext footnote 2) to masked human, cat, dog, and mouse references\nat 93% identity were removed. Another category of removed\nsequences matched RNA spike-in, PhiX, common microbial\ncontaminants, and ribosomal RNAs. The processed reads from\neach library were aligned to the reference genome using BBMap\nwith only unique mappings allowed (BAMs/directory). If a\nread mapped to more than one location it was ignored.\nfeatureCounts (Liao et al., 2014) was used to generate raw\ngene counts, which were normalized to adjust for the length of\neach gene and total number of reads mapped for each library.\nThe normalization formula used: n = [r/(l/1,000)]/(t/1,000,000),\nwhere n = normalized read count for gene (G) for library (L);\nr = raw read count for gene G for library L; l = gene G length; and\nt = total reads mapped for library L. Raw gene counts were used to\nevaluate the level of correlation between biological samples using\nPearson’s correlation.\nBioinformatic Analysis\nCount tables generated by the JGI RNA-Seq pipeline were input\ninto DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) to normalize and determine\n1https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/\ndifferential expression. Statistical significance was established\nthrough DESeq2 by using three biological replicates for control\nand root exudate conditions. Scatterplots were generated from\nthe DESeq2 data table outputs using ggplot2. Genes differentially\nexpressed between control and root exudate samples (log2 foldchanges\n–2 \u2000 to \u2000 2, adjusted p value \u2000 0.05) were used in\ndownstream analysis. The core genome and pangenome for the\nPseudomonas strains used in this study were computed using the\nOthoMCL v.2.0, Species Tree Builder v.2.2.0, and Phylogenetic\nPangenome Accumulation v1.4.0 apps implemented in the U.S.\nDepartment of Energy Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase)\n(Arkin et al., 2018). Additional comparisons were conducted\nwith the PGAweb pangenome analysis pipeline (Chen et al.,\n2018). Differentially expressed genes were assigned to core,\nnon-core, and singleton parts of each strain’s proteome by\nBLASTp with an E value cutoff of e-06, identity of 40%\nand coverage of 60%. Functional annotation of differentially\nexpressed genes was carried out with the Blast2GO (Conesa\nand Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al.,\n2018). Additional manual curation was performed using tools\nimplemented in the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG)\ndatabase (Markowitz et al., 2012), Pseudomonas Genome\nDatabase (Winsor et al., 2009), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and\nGenomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa et al., 2008), and Geneious 10.2.3\n(Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand). Metabolic functions\nencoded by the differentially expressed genes were mapped\nusing iPath 3.0 (Darzi et al., 2018). Phylogenetic analyses\nwere carried out by building multiple sequence alignments\nwith MAFFT v7.222 (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and inferring\nneighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenies with Geneious Tree Builder.\nThe resultant phylogenetic trees were visualized with iTOL\n(Letunic and Bork, 2016). Reproducibility of clades within the\ninferred NJ trees was assessed by bootstrap resampling with\n1,000 replicates.\nCharacterization of Carbon Source\nUtilization With Biolog Phenotype\nMicroarrays\nThe utilization of carbon sources was analyzed using Phenotype\nMicroArrays (Biolog, Hayward, CA, United States) as follows.\nThe bacteria were cultured overnight on Luria-Bertani agar\nat 25\u2000C, after which cells were harvested and suspended in\ninoculating fluid (IF-0). The transmittance of the suspension\nwas adjusted to 42% using a Biolog turbidimeter. The cell\nsuspension was mixed with IF\U001000000 containing Dye Mix A\n(Biolog) to achieve a final transmittance of 85%. One hundred\nmicroliter aliquots of the adjusted cell suspension were\ninoculated into PM01 and PM02A plates, which were then\nincubated in an OmniLog Phenotype MicroArray System\n(Biolog) at 25\u2000C for 48 h. The formation of formazan was\nrecorded at 15 min intervals, and data were analyzed using\nOmniLog Parametric Analysis software v1.20.02 (Biolog).\nRelative growth of the studied strains was normalized to\ngrowth on D-glucose and visualized using Heatmapper\n(Babicki et al., 2016).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 4 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nData Availability\nSequences generated in this project were deposited\nunder NCBI BioProject accession numbers PRJNA439743\nthrough PRJNA439790.\nRESULTS\nMetabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates\nof B. distachyon\nMetabolomics analysis of lyophilized root exudates revealed\nthe presence of numerous plant metabolites, 86 of which were\nidentified by matching their spectra to the LECO/Fiehn\nMetabolomics library (Supplementary Table 3). These\nmetabolites included (i) carbohydrates and their derivatives\n(glucose, fructose, xylose, sucrose, trehalose, maltose, galactose,\nand others); (ii) sugar alcohols (b-mannosylglycerate, myoinositol,\ngalactinol, 2-deoxyerythritol, ribitol, threitol and\ncellobitol); (iii) amino acids and derivatives (glutamine,\ntyrosine, glutamic acid, asparagine, aspartic acid, valine,\nphenylalanine, isoleucine, glycine, serine, proline, leucine,\ntryptophan, cysteine, methionine, citrulline, and others); (iv)\norganic acids (aconitic, allantoic, g-aminobutyric, azelaic, citric,\nfumaric, 2-furoic, D-glyceric, 3-hydroxypropionic, a-ketoadipic,\nmalic, methylmalonic, nicotinic, quinic, succinic, threonic);\nand (v) assorted metabolites including heterocyclic compounds,\nphenolics, and biogenic amines, etc (3-hydroxypyridine,\nmaleimide, noradrenaline, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoate,\n5-methoxytryptamine, uracil, aminomalonic acid, palmitic acid,\nand urea). Results of the analysis also revealed that root exudates\nof B. distachyon contain hydroxyectoine and the quaternary\namine (QA) glycine betaine (Supplementary Figure 1).\nPhylogenetic and Pangenome Analyses\nof Pseudomonas Strains Used in the\nStudy\nWe used a set of phylogenetic markers suggested by Mulet et al.\n(2010) to investigate the relatedness of the eight strains used in\nthis study to distinct lineages recognized within the P. fluorescens\nspecies complex. The multilocus sequence analysis based on\nthe concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S\nrRNA), gyrB, rpoB, and rpoD identified R1-43-08 (along with\nstrains 2-79 and SBW25) as a member of the P. fluorescens\nsubgroup (Figure 1). The rest of the strains clustered closely with\nfour additional subgroups of the P. fluorescens complex, namely\nP. corrugata (strains Q2-87 and Q8r1-96), P. koreensis (Pf0-1),\nP. protegens (Pf-5), and P. chlororaphis (30–84). The genomes of\nthe eight rhizosphere Pseudomonas strains varied in size by 1.43\nmegabase (ranging from 5.65 to 7.07 Mb) and contained between\n5,166 and 6,363 protein-coding genes (Figure 2A). The shared\ngene content was characterized with OrthoMCL, which uses allagainst-\nall BLASTp followed by the Markov Cluster algorithm to\nidentify protein groups shared between the compared genomes,\nas well as groups representing species-specific gene expansion\nfamilies (Li et al., 2003). The pangenome analysis revealed a\ncore comprised of approximately 3,179 orthologs that were\nshared among all strains and represented 50.0% to 61.5%\nof each predicted proteome (Figures 2A,B). The non-core\npangenome contained genes shared by two or more (but not\nall) strains and contained between 1,482 and 2,080 orthologs,\nwhich corresponded to 28.7–36.3% of individual proteomes. The\nrest of the predicted protein-coding genes were strain-specific\nsingletons that comprised 7.5% to 15.1% of the strain’s predicted\nproteomes. In respect to divergence from the core genome, strain\nPf-5 was found to possess the highest proportion of unique genes\n(n = 949) followed by 2-79 (n = 887). The entire pangenome of\nthe Pseudomonas strains encompassed over 12,000 homolog and\nsingleton gene families.\nFurther homolog family-based comparisons identified Q8r1-\n96 and R1-43-08 as the most distantly related strains, with\n3349 shared homologs (Supplementary Table 4A). Q8r1-96 and\nQ2-87, which shared 4,489 homologs, were the most closely\nrelated strains. The partitioning of homolog gene families into\nthe core, non-core, and singleton parts of the pangenome agreed\nwith phylogenetic relationships of the strains deduced from the\nanalysis of a selected subset of COGs (Clusters of Orthologous\nGroups) (Figure 2C and Supplementary Tables 4B,C). The\nCOG-based phylogeny supported the multilocus sequence\nanalysis and revealed that the eight Pseudomonas strains form\nthree distinct clusters, the first of which contained 2-79, R1-30-\n84, and SBW25. The second cluster included Q8r1-96 and Q2-87,\nwhereas the third encompassed strains 30-84, Pf-5, and Pf0-1.\nCorrelating the Composition of Root\nExudates With Metabolic Profiles of\nPseudomonas Strains\nWe used the Phenotype MicroArray PM1 and PM2 plates to\nprofile the eight Pseudomonas strains for the utilization of\n190 different carbon sources. Results of the analysis identified\n90 compounds that supported growth and clustered by their\nintensities of utilization into three distinct groups (Figure 3).\nGroup I was comprised of 30 highly metabolized carbon\nsources, which included several amino acids and intermediates of\nglycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, and citrate cycle. Approximately\nhalf of these compounds were catabolized by all eight strains,\nand included several organic acids (fumaric, citric, gluconic,\nmalic, and pyroglutamic), amino acids (Glu, Asn, Gln, Asp, Pro,\nAla, and g-aminobutyric acid), carbohydrates (glucose, mannose,\nand mannitol), and the purine nucleoside inosine. Group II\nwas composed of 44 chemically diverse carbon sources that\nwere variably utilized by the strains. These compounds were\ncarbohydrates, organic acids, amino acids, phenolics, and polyols,\nand included known compatible solutes and intermediates of\nmetabolism of pentoses, galactose, starch, and sucrose. Group\nIII encompassed the rest of the Phenotype MicroArray test\npanel and contained compounds that were not catabolized\nby the tested strains. Among several notable exceptions were\na-hydroxyglutamic acid- g-lactone, putrescine, and itaconic,\ncitramalic, and succinamic acids, which supported the growth\nof strains 2-79, 30-84, Pf-5, and SBW25.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nFIGURE 1 | Neighbor joining phylogeny showing the relationship of the eight strains used in this study (indicated by red triangles) to different species of the\nP. fluorescens complex. The phylogeny was established based on the concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S rRNA), gyrB (subunit B of DNA\ngyrase), rpoB (b subunit of RNA polymerase), and rpoD (sigma 70 factor subunit of RNA polymerase). Distance matrices were calculated by the Jukes-Cantor\nmethod. Colored circles on tree nodes indicate bootstrap values (1,000 replicates) that vary between 60% (smallest circle) and 100% (largest circles).\nB. distachyon Bd21. Interestingly, many carbon sources from\nthe Phenotype MicroArray panel were also present in the root\nexudates of B. distachyon Bd21, and some of these compounds\n(glucose, mannose, galactose, fructose, g-aminobutyric acid,\naspartic acid, citric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, quinic acid,\nalanine, glutamine, and glutamic acid) were catabolized by all\nstrains used in this study, while others (e.g., xylose, trehalose,\nm-inositol) were actively utilized only by certain organisms\n(Figure 3). The comparison of catabolic profiles across the\neight studied Pseudomonas strains revealed the presence of three\ndistinct clusters. The first cluster contained strains Q8r1-96 and\nQ2-87, which consumed very similar sets of carbon sources,\nas well as strain Pf0-1. The second cluster was composed of\n2-79, R1-43-08, SBW25, and 30-84, whereas the third cluster\nwas represented by a single strain, Pf-5. The overall similarity\nof the catabolic profiles partially agreed with the separation\nof the strains into different subgroups of the P. fluorescens\ncomplex (see above).\nAnalysis of the RNA-seq Results\nIn order to understand the cellular responses of rhizosphere\nPseudomonas to plant exometabolites, we analyzed the\ntranscriptome changes in cultures grown in the presence of\nroot exudates. Under field conditions, rhizobacteria colonize\nplant roots in the form of surface-attached microaerobic biofilms\n(Hojberg et al., 1999). To mimic these conditions, the eight\nPseudomonas strains were grown statically at 72% air saturation\nin 21C-glucose medium amended with root exudates and then\nprocessed to extract total RNA (Supplementary Figure 2).\nA total of 995 million raw sequencing reads were generated from\nthe RNA samples by using the Illumina HiSeq-2500 platform,\naveraging 20.7 million reads per sample. The removal of lowquality\nand rRNA sequences resulted in a total of 793 million\nfiltered reads that were mapped onto the eight Pseudomonas\ngenomes with a mean of 7.48 million mapped fragments per\ngenome. The differentially abundant transcripts were identified\nby setting a p value of 0.05 (adjusted for multiple testing) and\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 6 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

(B) The gradual expansion of\nthe pangenome (blue color) and contraction of the core genome (green color) following the sequential addition of genomes from the dataset. Box plots indicate the\n25th and 75th percentiles and medians (horizontal lines) with whiskers corresponding to the 10th and 90th percentiles. The input order was randomized to avoid any\nbias due to the sequential addition of new genomes. The pangenome size increases steadily without reaching a plateau even after the addition of 11,939\nnon-redundant gene families. At the same time, the core genome converged to 3,179 genes. (C) The pangenome-based phylogenomic analysis of the studied\nstrains. Here, the pangenome was defined with OrthoMCL, and orthologous gene sets were then partitioned into the core, singleton, and non-core (the remaining\northolog sets) categories. These categories were calculated for each node in the Maximum Likelihood species tree, using the set of genomes for which that node\nrepresents the ancestor. The results of the ortholog partitioning are shown in pie charts placed at tree nodes. Numbers indicate bootstrap support values. The\nanalysis was conducted in KBase (Arkin et al., 2018).\nthe log2 fold-change (FC) threshold \u2000\u2000 2.0 (Figure 4 and\nSupplementary Tables 5–12). When compared with the control\nconditions, an average of 204 genes per strain were differentially\nexpressed in the presence of root exudates, with the highest\n(n = 425) and lowest (n = 112) numbers observed, respectively,\nin SBW25 and Q2-87 (Figure 4). Overall, more genes were\ninduced than repressed in response to exudates, but the actual\nnumbers in each category varied substantially depending on the\nidentity of the Pseudomonas strain. In most strains, the bulk of\nthe differentially expressed genes was almost equally distributed\nbetween the core (mean, 48.2%) and non-core (mean, 45.8%)\nparts of the genome, whereas the strain-specific singleton genes\nconstituted on average only 5.9% (Figure 4B). One notable\nexception was observed in Q8r1-96, where all differentially\nexpressed genes belonged to the core (73.8%) and non-core\n(26.2%) parts of the genome. Another notable pattern was\nobserved in R1-43-08, where the majority of genes affected by\nthe presence of root exudate fell into the non-core category\n(56.3%). The highest proportion of differentially expressed\nsingletons (11.3 and 10.4%, respectively) was identified in\nstrains SBW25 and Pf-5.\nWe further explored how the identified differentially\nexpressed genes were distributed across genomes of the eight\nstudied rhizosphere strains. The pairwise BLASTp comparisons\nidentified 2-79 and SBW25 as two strains that shared the highest\nnumber of genes (n = 101) induced or repressed in response\nto root exudates (Table 1). The second pair of strains with\na significant number of similar differentially expressed genes\n(n = 86) was Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, which was followed by Pf0-1\nand 30-84, which shared 56 differentially expressed genes. These\npatterns of shared genes were also observed when the results of\nthe pairwise BLASTp comparisons were converted into a binary\ngene presence/absence matrix, which was then subjected to\ncluster analysis using a UPGMA algorithm based on Sorensen’s\ndissimilarity index or examined by non-metric multidimensional\nscaling (NMDS) (Figure 5).\nThe differentially expressed Pseudomonas genes were\nsubjected to Blast2Go analysis and Gene Ontology (GO)\nannotation (Figure 6). Metabolic process, catalytic activity,\nand membrane were the most common annotation terms\nacross the three primary GO term categories (i.e., biological\nprocess, molecular function, and cellular component). A total\nof 1,694 GO terms was assigned to 805 upregulated genes, with\nthe majority of the GO terms related to molecular function\n(682, 40.3%), followed by biological process (669, 39.5%), and\ncellular component (343, 20.2%). In the 539 downregulated gene\ncategory, 1,101 GO terms were assigned to biological process\n(420, 38.1%), molecular function (417, 37.9%), and cellular\ncomponent (264, 24.0%). Within biological process, metabolic\nprocess, cellular process, localization, response to stimulus, and\nregulation were over-represented. Within molecular function,\nthe largest proportion was assigned to catalytic activity, binding,\nand transporter activity categories. Within cellular component,\nthe majority were assigned to membrane, membrane part, cell,\nand cell part categories. Across the eight strains, 37–42% of\ndifferentially expressed genes had no Gene Ontology IDs and\nencoded various conserved hypothetical proteins.\nFunctional Classification of Shared\nDifferentially Expressed Genes\nThe interrogation of RNA-seq data revealed multiple cellular\npathways that were differentially regulated in bacterial cultures\nincubated with root exudates (Supplementary Figures 3, 4).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 7 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nFIGURE 3 | Biolog Phenotype MicroArray profiling the eight rhizosphere\nPseudomonas strains used in the study. The hierarchical clustering analysis\nwas carried out using the average linkage method with Euclidean distances.\nCarbon sources identified by red arrowheads were also detected in the sterile\nroot exudates of B. distachyon Bd21.\nAlthough none of these differentially regulated pathways were\nshared by all eight strains, the cross-strain comparisons revealed\nseveral types of common and specific transcriptomic responses\nthat were elicited by the presence of plant exometabolites\n(Table 2). The visual representation of core gene expression\npatterns is provided in Supplementary Figure 5, which\nshows heatmaps of expression profiles and p-adj values for\ncore genes shared by the studied strains. The figure is\naccompanied by Supplementary Table 13 that lists predicted\nfunctions of genes constituting the four distinct clusters\nobserved after hierarchical clustering of gene expression\nvalues. The first category of shared differentially expressed\npathways functioned in the uptake and catabolism of selected\ncarbohydrates, quaternary ammonium compounds (QAs), and\nphenolics. All strains except for R1-43-08, responded to root\nexudates by inducing the fructose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate\n(PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTSFru). The\ncomponents of this system are encoded by a conserved\noperon and include the cytoplasmic polyprotein EI/HPr/EIIAFru\n(FruB), the 1-phosphofructokinase FruK, and the fructosespecific\npermease EIIBC (FruA) (Chavarria et al., 2016). The\nPTSFru system functions by acquiring high-energy phosphates\nfrom PEP and sequentially passing them, via the EI/HPr/EIIAFru\ndomains of FruB, to the EIIB component of FruA. The\nphosphates are ultimately transferred by the EIIC transporter\nto fructose yielding fructose 1-phosphate, which is channeled\ninto the central metabolic pathways through the action of the\nphosphofructokinase FruK.\nIn all strains except for Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, the exposure to root\nexudates resulted in the induction of two genes adjacent to the\nfru cluster that encoded a Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS)\ntransporter and an L-arabinonate dehydratase (Table 2). These\ngenes are predicted to participate in the uptake and catabolism\nof L-arabinose, where L-arabinonate dehydratase plays an\nimportant role by converting L-arabinonate to 2-dehydro-3-\ndeoxy-L-arabinonate (Rahman et al., 2017). In SBW25, R1-\n43-08, and Q2-87, we also observed the induction of genes\nencoding components of the AraFGH complex, an ATP-Binding\nCassette (ABC) superfamily transporter involved in the import of\narabinose into the cell (Supplementary Tables 6, 7, 9). Finally, all\nstrains except SBW25 and R1-43-08 responded to the presence\nof exudates by upregulating a conserved gene encoding an\naldose epimerase superfamily protein. Such enzymes equilibrate\nalpha- and beta-anomers of aldoses and ensure that stereospecific\nenzymes involved in the metabolism of free sugars do not act as\nmetabolic bottlenecks (Abayakoon et al., 2018). Although some\naldose epimerases have been linked to specific pathways, the\nPseudomonas gene identified in this study could not be assigned\nto a particular metabolic process based on sequence analysis and\ngenomic location.\nSeveral Pseudomonas strains responded to the presence\nof root exudates by upregulating genes involved in the\nuptake and catabolism of myo-inositol and possibly other\nstereoisomers of inositol (Table 2). The upregulated catabolic\ngenes encode the dehydrogenase IolG, which oxidizes myoinositol\nto its corresponding ketone, as well as IolE, IolD, IolB,\nand IolC that collectively convert the 2-keto-myo-inositol to\nacetyl-CoA and the glycolysis intermediate dihydroxyacetone\nphosphate (Yoshida et al., 2008; Kohler et al., 2011).

The cross-genome comparisons revealed\nthat in all studied strains except for Pf0-1, components\nof the myo-inositol utilization pathway were encoded\nwithin a well-conserved gene cluster which, in addition to\ncatabolic and transport functions, also encodes a dedicated\ntranscriptional repressor.\nAll studied strains of Pseudomonas carry multiple genes\ninvolved in scavenging the quaternary ammonium compounds\ncholine, glycine betaine (GB), carnitine, choline-O-sulfate, and\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 9 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

Many of these genes were\ndifferentially expressed, including those encoding parts of the\nABC transporter CbcXWV, which is predicted to function in\nthe uptake of choline under water-replete conditions (Table 2).\nAmong enzymes induced in the presence of root exudates were\nthe choline dehydrogenase BetA, which converts choline to\nglycine betaine and a network of enzymes (i.e., the Rieske family\noxygenase GbcAB, the dimethyglycine demethylase DgcAB, and\nthe sarcosine oxidase SoxBDAG) that sequentially convert GB\nto glycine. In 2-79 and SBW25, this group of differentially\nregulated genes also included an AraC-family transcriptional\nactivator GbdR, which perceives intercellular levels of GB and\ninduces genes involved in the transport and catabolism of\nglycine betaine and detoxification of the catabolic byproducts\n(Hampel et al., 2014).\nThe last category of activated catabolic pathways included the\ncatechol branch of the b-ketoadipate pathway for the degradation\nof aromatic compounds. In strains 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5,\ngrowth on root exudates resulted in upregulation of catechol-\n1,2-dioxygenase, muconate cycloisomerase, and muconolactone\nisomerase, which collectively cleave the catechol ring and\nconvert it to b-ketoadipate enol-lactone (Harwood and Parales,\n1996). Finally, analysis of the P. synxantha 2-79 transcriptome\nidentified an induction of benABC genes encoding subunits\nof benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase, an oxidoreductase that generates\ncatechol from benzoate.\nIn addition to various catabolic pathways, the exposure to root\nexudates also induced several genes involved in the homeostasis\nof copper (Table 2). Four of these genes form a conserved cluster\nin genomes of the strains and encode the periplasmic coppersensing\ntwo-component system CinRS, the plastocyanin/azurinlike\nprotein CinA, and the NADPH-dependent pre-Q0 reductase\nCinQ. Also, in strains Q2-87, 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, we observed\nupregulation of a conserved operon encoding the multicopper\noxidase CopA, the periplasmic copper-binding protein CopC, the\ninner membrane protein CopD, and outer membrane protein\nCopB. In several Gram-negative bacteria, these Cop proteins are\nthought to have dual functions and participate both in the uptake\nof essential copper as well as in the sequestration of excess copper\nin the periplasm and outer membrane.\nThe analysis of shared downregulated pathways revealed that\nmost of the strains respond to the presence of root exudates by\nrepressing genes involved in the uptake and catabolism of sulfur\ncompounds (Table 2). In strains SBW25, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96,\nQ2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, this response involved the ssuEADCB\noperon responsible for the utilization of alkanesulfonates\nas sulfur sources. The ssu operon is highly conserved in\nfluorescent pseudomonads and encodes the FMNH2-dependent\nmonooxygenase SsuD and the NAD (P)H-dependent FMN\nreductase SsuE, which together catalyze the desulfonation of\nalkanesulfonates. Also, the ssu locus contains genes for the\nmolybdopterin-binding protein SsuF and the alkanesulfonatespecific\nABC-type transporter consisting of the sulfonate\nsubstrate-binding protein SsuA, sulfonate permease protein\nSsuC, and sulfonate transport ATP-binding protein SsuB. Finally,\nin R1-43-08, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, growth on root exudates\ncoincided with repression of the tauABCD operon, which\nallows these strains to utilize taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonate)\nas a sulfur source. The repressed tau genes encoded the\n2-oxoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenase TauD and\nsubstrate-binding, ATP-binding, and permease components of\nthe taurine-specific ABC transporter TauABC.\nOther Differentially Expressed Pathways\nIn addition to their effect on several shared cellular pathways,\ngrowth on root exudates resulted in the induction or repression of\nnumerous strain-specific genes. In closely related P. synxantha 2-\n79 and P. fluorescens SBW25, we observed differential expression\nof genes involved in energy metabolism, transport of amino\nacids, and surface attachment (Supplementary Tables 5, 6).\nOther notable differentially expressed pathways included 2–\n79 gene clusters that encode enzymes for the catabolism of\ntrehalose, a prophage, and toxin/antitoxin system, as well as the\nSBW25 operon predicted to control the synthesis of the capsular\nexopolysaccharide colonic acid. The response of Pseudomonas sp.\nR1-43-08 to root exudates also involved differential expression\nof different energy metabolism pathways. In addition, we\nobserved the upregulation of genes involved in the uptake and\ncatabolism of xylose (also upregulated in 2–79) and repression\nof enzymes for the biosynthesis of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid\nand assimilation of inorganic sulfur and L-cysteine biosynthesis\n(Supplementary Table 7).\nThe analysis of the Q8r1-96 transcriptome revealed\nperturbation of different metabolic pathways including genes\nencoding components of cytochrome C oxidase, transport\nand catabolism of sorbitol/mannitol, metabolism of butanoic\nacid, and biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides alginate and\npoly-b-1-6-N-acetylglucosamine (Supplementary Table 8). In\nP. fluorescens Q2-87, we identified differential expression of\ngenes involved in metabolism of galactose, tryptophan, tyrosine,\nglycine, serine, and threonine (Supplementary Table 9),\nwhile in P. chlororaphis 30-84, growth on exudates activated\nthe biosynthesis of molybdopterin cofactor, catabolism of\ngalactonate and acetoin, and uptake and catabolism of putrescine\n(Supplementary Table 10). The response of P. protegens Pf-5 to\nroot exudates involved upregulation of acetoin dehydrogenase,\nwhich converts acetoin to acetaldehyde and acetyl-CoA, as\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 10 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al.

The terms were derived from 93 different functional groups (GO subcategories level 4). The GO terms were assigned with Blast2GO (Conesa\nand Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al., 2018). On a WEGO histogram, the percentage of 100 is defined as the total number of genes assigned a GO\nterm. However, the subcategories do not add up to 100% because many genes fall into more than one functional class and are therefore annotated by multiple GO\nterms.\nwell as pathways for the utilization of glycolate and putrescine\n(Supplementary Table 11). Also induced were genes for\nthe production of pyrrolnitrin and PhlG hydrolase, which\nmodulate the metabolic loads attributed to the synthesis of\n2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol. The differentially expressed genes of\nP. fluorescens Pf0-1 included, among others, operons encoding\ncytochrome C oxidase and enzymes for catabolism of malonic\nacid (Supplementary Table 12). Yet another interesting\nfinding involved the induction of assorted genes acting in the\nhomeostasis of iron and defense against reactive oxygen species\n(ROS). We observed activation of iron dicitrate transporters\n(SBW25 and 30-84), genes for the biosynthesis of siderophores\nornicorrugatin (SBW25) and pyochelin (Pf-5), heme-degrading\nenzymes (2–79, 30–84), TonB siderophore receptors, and\ncomponents of the energy-transducing inner membrane\ncomplex TonB-ExbB-ExbD (2–79 and Pf-5). The differentially\nexpressed ROS defense pathways were represented by different\ncatalases in strains 2–79, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and\nPf-5 and organic hydroperoxide resistance proteins in strains\nSBW25 and R1-43-08.

The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nsoil microorganisms. Our results were in agreement with a\nrecent report of 27 different sugars, amino acids, and organic\nacids in Brachypodium exudates (Kawasaki et al., 2016). We\nconfirmed the presence of exometabolites identified in that\nstudy, along with dozens of additional analytes that were\nidentified by matching their mass-spectra and retention indices\nto the LECO/Fiehn Metabolomics library (Supplementary\nTable 3). The complementation of the metabolomic analysis\nwith profiling of the bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays\nrevealed that a substantial proportion of the characterized\nexudate constituents were catabolized by a collection of eight\nPseudomonas strains from across the P. fluorescens group that is\nknown to form associations with plant roots. The amendment\nof Pseudomonas cultures with root exudates caused changes in\nthe expression of multiple genes encoding catabolic and anabolic\nenzymes, predicted transporters, transcriptional regulators, stress\nresponse, and conserved hypothetical proteins. In most strains,\nthese differentially expressed genes were almost equally split\nbetween the core and variable genome regions, mirroring\nthe substantial strain-to-strain variation in the genome size\nand gene content within the P. fluorescens species complex\n(Loper et al., 2012).\nThe analysis of transcriptome responses to root exudates\nrevealed several types of cellular pathways present in the strains\nused in this study. The first category of such pathways was\ninvolved in the catabolism of carbohydrates such as fructose,\narabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, trehalose, and galactose. Among\nthese catabolic traits, the ability to utilize fructose as a carbon\nsource is highly conserved among fluorescent pseudomonads.\nIn contrast, growth on arabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, and\ntrehalose is variably present and was traditionally used to\ndifferentiate species and biovars within the P. fluorescens\ngroup (Barrett et al., 1986). We speculate that such variably\ndistributed pathways contribute to the differential affinity of\npseudomonads toward host plants and/or to determine which\nstrains flourish in response to growing roots and changing\nenvironments. Several independent studies have confirmed\nthe importance of carbohydrate catabolism pathways for the\nbiology of rhizosphere pseudomonads. For example, in vivo\nexpression technology (IVET) profiling of P. fluorescens SBW25\nidentified xylose isomerase among genome regions essential\nfor the colonization of sugar beet seedlings (Liu et al., 2015),\nwhereas a genome-wide Tn-Seq screen of Pseudomonas simiae\nidentified genes for the catabolism of myo-inositol among traits\nessential for the colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana roots\n(Cole et al., 2017).\nThe response of rhizosphere Pseudomonas to Brachypodium\nroot exudates also involved pathways for the uptake and\nmetabolism of amino acids. We observed differential\nexpression of genes encoding the hydrophobic (HAAT) and\npolar (PAAT) amino acid uptake transporters in strains\n2-79, SBW25, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5. Other related genes\nencoded enzymes for the catabolism of valine and glutamic\nacid (2-79); metabolism of tryptophan, glycine, serine, and\nthreonine (Q2-87); and biosynthesis of methionine (Q8r1-\n96). It is plausible that the abundance of amino acids in\nroot exudates is also linked to the repression of pathways\ninvolved in the catabolism of sulfonates and taurine that\nwas observed in several strains (Table 2). Although the\npreferred source of sulfur for P. fluorescens is unknown, in the\nclosely related P. aeruginosa, the sulfur starvation response\nis triggered by the growth on any sulfur compound other\nthan sulfate, thiocyanate, and cysteine (Hummerjohann et al.,\n1998). This fact, together with the presence of cysteine and\ncystine in the root exudates, suggest that root exudates of\nBrachypodium may serve as an important source of sulfur for\nrhizosphere Pseudomonas. These findings also agree well with\nthe reported scarcity of inorganic sulfate in the soil, and the\npresence of sulfur mostly in the form of organic compounds,\nincluding amino acids, proteins, sulfate esters, and sulfonates\n(Autry and Fitzgerald, 1990).\nAnother interesting result of this study was the concerted\nactivation of copper and iron homeostasis pathways observed\nin all of the Pseudomonas strains used in this work. In bacteria,\nan excess of copper is toxic and triggers oxidative stress due to\nthe formation of free radicals, as well as disruption of protein\nmetalation and stability of iron-sulfur clusters (Bondarczuk\nand Piotrowska-Seget, 2013). On the other hand, copper is an\nessential trace element used as a cofactor in different enzymes.\nSimilarly, although elevated levels of iron cause redox stress, this\nelement is also found in active energy metabolism enzymes and is\ncrucial for bacterial growth (Andrews et al., 2003). The analysis\nof metal homeostasis genes identified in this study suggests\nthat their induction was likely triggered by the deficiency of\ncopper and iron in bacterial cultures grown in the presence of\nroot exudates. We attribute this effect to the ability of some\ncomponents of root exudates to chelate soil metals.\nDespite the abundance of iron in the soil, its bioavailability\nis limited due to the low solubility of Fe (III) oxyhydrates\nat neutral pH. The non-graminaceous plants circumvent this\nproblem by acidifying the rhizosphere and secreting flavins,\nphenolics, and organic acids that chelate iron. The reduction\nof these ferric chelates releases soluble ferrous iron taken up\nby root cells (Kobayashi and Nishizawa, 2012). Graminaceous\nplants, like Brachypodium, acquire iron by secreting into the\nsoil non-protein amino acids of the mugineic acid (MA) group,\nwhich act as Fe (III)-chelating phytosiderophores. In addition to\niron, low-molecular-weight organic acids and phytosiderophores\nbind other divalent and trivalent metals (including copper) and\ncontribute to heavy-metal tolerance in plants (Chen et al., 2017).\nIt is plausible that the presence of these plant exometabolites\nis responsible for the deficit of iron and copper observed in\nPseudomonas cultures grown in the presence of root exudates.\nThese results further underscore the importance of diverse and\nredundant metal homeostasis pathways found in genomes of the\nP. fluorescens group for the ability of these organisms to colonize\nand persist in the plant rhizosphere.\nRecently, Klonowska et al. (2018) examined transcriptomic\nresponses of symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria to root\nexudates of the legume plant Mimosa pundica, which has\nan unusual ability to support both alpha- (Rhizobium) and\nbeta-rhizobia (Cupriavidus and Burkholderia). Using RNA-seq,\nthe authors characterized genes involved in the perception of\nroot exudates in the nodulating bacteria Burkholderia phymatum\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 14 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282\nMavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome\nSTM815, Cupriavidus taiwanensis LMG19424, and Rhizobium\nmesoamericanum STM3625. Interestingly, the analysis of\ndifferentially expressed genes revealed induction of pathways\ninvolved in the catabolism of fructose, xylose, myo-inositol,\nand protocatechuate/catechol. Also upregulated were some\ncopper homeostasis, siderophore biosynthesis, and oxidative\nstress genes. Finally, the analytical profiling of M. pundica\nexudates revealed an overlap with Brachypodium in the types of\ncarbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids present. These\nfindings suggest that differentially expressed genes shared by\nmultiple strains of the group P. fluorescens are not unique to\nthe Brachypodium-Pseudomonas system but represent a set\nof conserved cellular pathways involved in the perception of\nplant exometabolites by different clades of rhizosphere-dwelling\nProteobacteria.\nMost strains included in this study were originally selected\nbased on the ability to colonize the rhizosphere and produce\nsecondary metabolites that alleviate the plant stress response\nand/or inhibit soilborne pathogens. It has been suggested\nthat plant metabolites released into the rhizosphere affect\nthe biocontrol activity of plant-beneficial pseudomonads (de\nWerra et al., 2011). We provide further support to this\nhypothesis by demonstrating that in some strains, root exudates\nmodulate the expression of genes for the catabolism of\nthe plant growth-promoting metabolites acetoin and 2,3-\nbutanediol. The exposure to exudates also affected the expression\nof genes for the synthesis of well-characterized antifungal\ncompounds pyrrolnitrin, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, and 2,4-\ndiacetylphloroglucinol. The modulatory effects were strainspecific,\nsuggesting significant differences in the regulatory\nnetworks involved in the perception of plant signals and\nregulation of the production of antibiotics and growthpromoting\nmetabolites.\nThe final significant finding of this study was the induction\nof catabolism of quaternary amines (QAs) observed in multiple\nstrains of the P. fluorescens group during growth on root\nexudates. This observation was supported by the detection of\nglycine betaine in the root secretions of B. distachyon. The\npresence of QAs in plant tissues and the capacity of these\nmetabolites to provide stress protection and nutrients to plant\npathogens and symbionts were reported before (Boncompagni\net al., 1999; Chen et al., 2013; Kabbadj et al., 2017), but our\nstudy is among the first to highlight the potential importance of\nthese metabolites for rhizosphere interactions. Pseudomonads do\nnot synthesize QAs de novo but have evolved many pathways to\nscavenge them from eukaryotic hosts, where these metabolites\nare abundant due to the prominence of phosphatidylcholine\nin cellular membranes. Strains of P. fluorescens carry genes\nfor the conversion of choline, carnitine, and glycine betaine to\nglycine, as well as quaternary amine transporters of the BCCT\nand ABC families that are also conserved in the opportunistic\nhuman pathogen P. aeruginosa and the plant pathogen P. syringae\n(Galvao et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2013; Wargo, 2013b).\nIn P. aeruginosa, choline catabolism genes are essential for\nthe ability of this pathogen to persist during lung infection\n(Wargo, 2013a). Similarly, a P. syringae mutant deficient in\nBetT, OpuC, and CbcXWV quaternary amine transporters had\nreduced fitness during colonization of bean and soybean leaves\nunder greenhouse and field conditions (Chen et al., 2013).\nDepending on water availability, P. aeruginosa and P. syringae\ncatabolize exogenously supplied QAs as carbon and nitrogen\nsources or accumulate them as osmoprotectants (Chen et al.,\n2013; Wargo, 2013b). Our ongoing work in P. synxantha 2–\n79 unraveled similar physiological responses and demonstrated\nthat QA transporters function differentially and redundantly\nin the uptake of quaternary amines as nutrients (Pablo and\nMavrodi, unpublished). In contrast, under water stress, the QAs\ncholine, betaine, and carnitine are accumulated preferentially for\nosmoprotection. Under drought stress, a 2–79 mutant devoid\nof all known QA transporters was less competitive in the\ncolonization of the Brachypodium rhizosphere than its wild-type\nparental strain. Interestingly, our metabolomic profiling of root\nexudates also revealed proline, glutamine, and hydroxyectoine.\nThese metabolites act as compatible solutes in different groups\nof microorganisms (Yancey et al., 1982; Empadinhas and da\nCosta, 2008), suggesting an important role of root exudates\nin the ability of Pseudomonas to persist in the rhizosphere of\ndrought-stressed plants.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe original contributions presented in the study are publicly\navailable.

experiments: The experiment aimed to examine the molecular communication between beneficial rhizosphere bacteria (Pseudomonas spp.) and their host plant (Brachypodium distachyon). Researchers collected root exudates from B. distachyon by growing surface-sterilized plants hydroponically in sterile jars filled with glass beads and distilled water in a controlled environment (20-hour light at 24°C, 4-hour dark at 18°C). Root exudates were extracted, sterilized with 0.22 µm filtration, lyophilized, and stored at –80°C. The composition of the collected root exudates was analyzed via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). For LC-MS, a Synapt G2-S quadrupole-ion mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometer and an Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatograph (UPLC) with photodiode array detection were used, while GC-MS analysis was performed with a Pegasus 4D time-of-flight mass spectrometer coupled to an Agilent 7890A GC. Sixty-day-old cultures of eight Pseudomonas fluorescens-group strains were grown on medium amended with Brachypodium root exudates under controlled microaerobic (15% O2) conditions. Differential gene expression in response to root exudates was assessed using transcriptomics (RNA-seq), with RNA samples depleted of rRNA prior to stranded library preparation and sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Metabolic capabilities of these Pseudomonas strains were further characterized using Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays (PM01 and PM2A plates), incubated in an OmniLog Phenotype MicroArray System at 25°C for 48 hours to profile the catabolism of diverse carbon sources. Optical density and colorimetric respiration data (formazan production, absorbance detection at 590 nm) were collected every 15 minutes. Each experiment had three biological replicates. Analysis of Biolog data was performed using OmniLog Parametric Analysis software v1.20.02. For transcriptomic data, DESeq2 and various comparative genomic tools (e.g., OrthoMCL, COG-based phylogeny) were used to identify differentially expressed genes and functional annotations. Data collection and incubations lasted for 20-22 hours at 25°C. The experimental analyses revealed changes in gene expression associated with plant metabolite catabolism, transport, stress responses (e.g., oxidative and metal stresses), biocontrol activities, and suggested the importance of root-secreted osmoprotectants for bacterial rhizosphere colonization.

Researchers collected root exudates from B. distachyon by growing surface-sterilized plants hydroponically in sterile jars filled with glass beads and distilled water in a controlled environment (20-hour light at 24°C, 4-hour dark at 18°C). Root exudates were extracted, sterilized with 0.22 µm filtration, lyophilized, and stored at –80°C. The composition of the collected root exudates was analyzed via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). For LC-MS, a Synapt G2-S quadrupole-ion mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometer and an Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatograph (UPLC) with photodiode array detection were used, while GC-MS analysis was performed with a Pegasus 4D time-of-flight mass spectrometer coupled to an Agilent 7890A GC. Sixty-day-old cultures of eight Pseudomonas fluorescens-group strains were grown on medium amended with Brachypodium root exudates under controlled microaerobic (15% O2) conditions. Differential gene expression in response to root exudates was assessed using transcriptomics (RNA-seq), with RNA samples depleted of rRNA prior to stranded library preparation and sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Metabolic capabilities of these Pseudomonas strains were further characterized using Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays (PM01 and PM2A plates), incubated in an OmniLog Phenotype MicroArray System at 25°C for 48 hours to profile the catabolism of diverse carbon sources.

Researchers collected root exudates from B. distachyon by growing surface-sterilized plants hydroponically in sterile jars filled with glass beads and distilled water in a controlled environment (20-hour light at 24°C, 4-hour dark at 18°C). Root exudates were extracted, sterilized with 0.22 µm filtration, lyophilized, and stored at –80°C. The composition of the collected root exudates was analyzed via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). For LC-MS, a Synapt G2-S quadrupole-ion mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometer and an Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatograph (UPLC) with photodiode array detection were used, while GC-MS analysis was performed with a Pegasus 4D time-of-flight mass spectrometer coupled to an Agilent 7890A GC. Sixty-day-old cultures of eight Pseudomonas fluorescens-group strains were grown on medium amended with Brachypodium root exudates under controlled microaerobic (15% O2) conditions. Differential gene expression in response to root exudates was assessed using transcriptomics (RNA-seq), with RNA samples depleted of rRNA prior to stranded library preparation and sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Metabolic capabilities of these Pseudomonas strains were further characterized using Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays (PM01 and PM2A plates), incubated in an OmniLog Phenotype MicroArray System at 25°C for 48 hours to profile the catabolism of diverse carbon sources. Optical density and colorimetric respiration data (formazan production, absorbance detection at 590 nm) were collected every 15 minutes. Each experiment had three biological replicates. Analysis of Biolog data was performed using OmniLog Parametric Analysis software v1.20.02. For transcriptomic data, DESeq2 and various comparative genomic tools (e.g., OrthoMCL, COG-based phylogeny) were used to identify differentially expressed genes and functional annotations. Data collection and incubations lasted for 20-22 hours at 25°C. The experimental analyses revealed changes in gene expression associated with plant metabolite catabolism, transport, stress responses (e.g., oxidative and metal stresses), biocontrol activities, and suggested the importance of root-secreted osmoprotectants for bacterial rhizosphere colonization.\n\n===\n\n", 'role': 'user'}], 'temperature': 1.0, 'extra_body': {}}}

Researchers collected root exudates from B. distachyon by growing surface-sterilized plants hydroponically in sterile jars filled with glass beads and distilled water in a controlled environment (20-hour light at 24°C, 4-hour dark at 18°C). Root exudates were extracted, sterilized with 0.22 µm filtration, lyophilized, and stored at –80°C. The composition of the collected root exudates was analyzed via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). For LC-MS, a Synapt G2-S quadrupole-ion mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometer and an Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatograph (UPLC) with photodiode array detection were used, while GC-MS analysis was performed with a Pegasus 4D time-of-flight mass spectrometer coupled to an Agilent 7890A GC. Sixty-day-old cultures of eight Pseudomonas fluorescens-group strains were grown on medium amended with Brachypodium root exudates under controlled microaerobic (15% O2) conditions. Differential gene expression in response to root exudates was assessed using transcriptomics (RNA-seq), with RNA samples depleted of rRNA prior to stranded library preparation and sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Metabolic capabilities of these Pseudomonas strains were further characterized using Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays (PM01 and PM2A plates), incubated in an OmniLog Phenotype MicroArray System at 25°C for 48 hours to profile the catabolism of diverse carbon sources. Optical density and colorimetric respiration data (formazan production, absorbance detection at 590 nm) were collected every 15 minutes. Each experiment had three biological replicates. Analysis of Biolog data was performed using OmniLog Parametric Analysis software v1.20.02. For transcriptomic data, DESeq2 and various comparative genomic tools (e.g., OrthoMCL, COG-based phylogeny) were used to identify differentially expressed genes and functional annotations. Data collection and incubations lasted for 20-22 hours at 25°C. The experimental analyses revealed changes in gene expression associated with plant metabolite catabolism, transport, stress responses (e.g., oxidative and metal stresses), biocontrol activities, and suggested the importance of root-secreted osmoprotectants for bacterial rhizosphere colonization.\n\n===\n\n", 'role': 'user'}]temperature: 1.0

  Plants live in association with microorganisms that positively influence plant
  development, vigor, and fitness in response to pathogens and abiotic stressors.
  The bulk of the plant microbiome is concentrated belowground at the plant rootsoil
  interface. Plant roots secrete carbon-rich rhizodeposits containing primary and
  secondary low molecular weight metabolites, lysates, and mucilages. These exudates
  provide nutrients for soil microorganisms and modulate their affinity to host plants, but
  molecular details of this process are largely unresolved. We addressed this gap by
  focusing on the molecular dialog between eight well-characterized beneficial strains
  of the Pseudomonas fluorescens group and Brachypodium distachyon, a model for
  economically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops of the grass family. We
  collected and analyzed root exudates of B. distachyon and demonstrated the presence
  of multiple carbohydrates, amino acids, organic acids, and phenolic compounds. The
  subsequent screening of bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays revealed that many
  of these metabolites provide carbon and energy for the Pseudomonas strains. RNAseq
  profiling of bacterial cultures amended with root exudates revealed changes in the
  expression of genes encoding numerous catabolic and anabolic enzymes, transporters,
  transcriptional regulators, stress response, and conserved hypothetical proteins. Almost
  half of the differentially expressed genes mapped to the variable part of the strains’
  pangenome, reflecting the importance of the variable gene content in the adaptation of
  P. fluorescens to the rhizosphere lifestyle. Our results collectively reveal the diversity
  of cellular pathways and physiological responses underlying the establishment of
  mutualistic interactions between these beneficial rhizobacteria and their plant hosts.

  INTRODUCTION
  Plants are meta-organisms or holobionts that rely in part on
  their microbiome for specific functions and traits. The ability
  of the plant microbiome to influence plant development, vigor,
  health, and fitness in response to abiotic stressors associated
  with global climate change is documented by numerous studies
  (Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009). There is mounting evidence
  that plants actively recruit beneficial microbiomes, but many
  aspects of this process are still very much a black box (Reinhold-
  Hurek et al., 2015). The foundation for the differential affinity
  of rhizobacteria toward host plants is built upon complex
  chemical cross talk between microorganisms and plant roots.
  Up to 40% of photosynthetically fixed carbon is released by
  plant roots in the form of exudates and secretions, lysates, and
  mucilages (Curl and Truelove, 1986; Lynch, 1990; Whipps, 1990;
  Badri and Vivanco, 2009). The release of these compounds is
  actively controlled in response to environmental stimuli, and the
  composition of root exudates varies greatly according to plant
  species and physiological condition (Lynch, 1990; Nguyen, 2003;
  Phillips et al., 2004; De-la-Pena et al., 2008). The presence and
  composition of exudates strongly impact soil microorganisms,
  which is consistent with the idea that plants actively select and
  shape their root microbiota (Zolla et al., 2013).
  Primary root exudates include simple and complex sugars,
  amino acids, polypeptides and proteins, organic, aliphatic and
  fatty acids, sterols, and phenolics (Nguyen, 2003; Badri and
  Vivanco, 2009; Badri et al., 2009). These compounds serve as
  carbon and energy sources for rhizobacteria, and the presence
  of the intact corresponding catabolic pathways is essential
  for competitive colonization of roots and disease suppression
  (Lugtenberg et al., 2001; Kamilova et al., 2005; Lugtenberg and
  Kamilova, 2009). Root exudates also contain numerous signal
  molecules and secondary metabolites, the significance of which
  is only now emerging (Walker et al., 2003; Bais et al., 2005,
  2006). A handful of analyses of plant-induced gene expression
  by transcriptional profiling in vitro (Mark et al., 2005) or in
  the rhizosphere (Silby and Levy, 2004; Ramos-Gonzalez et al.,
  2005; Matilla et al., 2007; Barret et al., 2009) have identified
  multiple genes that are differentially regulated by exposure to
  roots or root exudates. Bacterial pathways expressed during
  rhizosphere colonization control utilization of plant-derived
  metabolites (Simons et al., 1996, 1997; Camacho-Carvajal, 2001;
  Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), motility and chemotaxis (de
  Weert et al., 2002; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), phase
  variation (Dekkers et al., 1998; Sanchez-Contreras et al., 2002;
  van den Broek et al., 2005), outer membrane integrity (de Weert
  et al., 2006; Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009), and the ability
  to sequester limiting resources (Raaijmakers et al., 1995) and
  resist environmental stresses (Sarniguet et al., 1995; Miller and
  Wood, 1996; van Veen et al., 1997; Schnider-Keel et al., 2001). In
  its spatial and temporal properties, root colonization resembles
  biofilm formation, and biofilm-related pathways also have been
  implicated in adhesion to seeds and roots and rhizosphere
  colonization (Espinosa-Urgel et al., 2000; Hinsa et al., 2003;
  Yousef-Coronado et al., 2008; Fuqua, 2010; Martinez-Gil et al.,
  2010; Nielsen et al., 2011; Zboralski and Filion, 2020). Finally,
  root exudates strongly affect the expression of diverse plant
  growth promotion and biocontrol genes (Vacheron et al., 2013).
  Over the past decade, the genomes of numerous rhizosphere
  strains have been sequenced and analyzed, but functional
  genomics studies of rhizosphere competence lag behind the
  availability of sequence data.
  This study explored the molecular dialog between the
  model host plant Brachypodium distachyon and several wellcharacterized
  rhizosphere strains of the Pseudomonas fluorescens
  group. Brachypodium is a small annual grass originating in semiarid
  regions of the Middle East that has emerged as a prime model
  for economically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops
  of the grass family (Bevan et al., 2010; Schwartz et al., 2010;
  Brkljacic et al., 2011; Hong et al., 2011; Tyler et al., 2014). The
  biology, extensive collection of resources, and research tools
  make B. distachyon an attractive model to investigate interactions
  between plants and root-associated microbes. Pseudomonads
  are ubiquitous Gram-negative g-proteobacteria that colonize
  eukaryotic hosts and include both commensals and economically
  important pathogens of plants and animals (Moore et al.,
  2006; Schroth et al., 2006; Yahr and Parsek, 2006). The genus
  Pseudomonas currently comprises > 100 named species that have
  been separated based on multilocus sequence analysis into 14
  species groups (Garrido-Sanz et al., 2016; Hesse et al., 2018).
  The P. fluorescens group is the most diverse regarding both
  the genetic distances within it, the number of species and the
  large pangenome that makes up > 50% of the pangenome
  of the genus as a whole (Loper et al., 2012). The group also
  encompasses an unusually high proportion of strains that inhabit
  the plant rhizosphere and possess plant growth promoting and
  biocontrol properties. Naylor et al. (2017) profiled bacterial
  communities associated with root tissues and rhizosphere of
  18 different plant species of the Poaceae family. That study
  identified Pseudomonas among taxa constituting the core grass
  root microbiome and demonstrated that these bacteria were
  enriched in C3 plants, including wheat, rye, barley, oat, and
  Brachypodium. We confirmed the capacity of B. distachyon
  Bd21 to serve as a host for rhizobacteria of the P. fluorescens
  group in preliminary greenhouse assays with biocontrol strains
  P. synxantha 2-79, P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96, and P. protegens
  Pf-5. Results of these experiments revealed that all strains
  successfully established and colonized the roots of Brachypodium
  (Supplementary Table 1).
  In this study, we focused on eight well-studied strains
  of the P. fluorescens complex that are supported by years
  of studies, numerous refereed publications, and high-quality
  genome sequences. By profiling transcriptomes of these strains
  during growth in root exudates of B. distachyon, we revealed the
  diversity of cellular pathways and physiological responses that
  underlie the establishment of mutualistic interactions between
  beneficial rhizobacteria and the host plant. Our results also
  confirmed that root exudates contain carbohydrates, amino acids,
  organic acids, and phenolics that serve as carbon and energy
  sources for rhizobacteria. The root exudates also contained
  osmoprotectants that may help microorganisms to persist in the
  rhizosphere of drought-stressed plants. The diversity of microbial
  genes perturbed by root exudates reflects the importance of

  MATERIALS AND METHODS
  Bacterial Strains Used in the Study
  The eight Pseudomonas strains used for this study are
  P. synxantha 2-79 (Thomashow and Weller, 1988), P. fluorescens
  SBW25 (Silby et al., 2009), Pseudomonas sp. R1-43-08 (Parejko
  et al., 2012), P. brassicacearum Q8r1-96 (Raaijmakers and Weller,
  1998), P. fluorescens Q2-87 (Bangera and Thomashow, 1996),
  P. chlororaphis 30-84 (Thomashow et al., 1990), P. fluorescens
  Pf0-1 (Silby et al., 2009), and P. protegens Pf-5 (Howell and
  Stipanovic, 1980). The selected organisms have been studied
  extensively for their role in biological control and plant
  growth promotion (Supplementary Table 2). The strains were
  maintained in the laboratory as frozen stocks (􀀀80 C) and
  routinely cultured in King’s medium B (King et al., 1954) or
  21C medium, which contained (per 1 L): 1.0 g of NH4Cl, 3.5 g
  of Na2HPO4 2H2O, 2.8 g of KH2PO4, 3.0 g of glucose, and
  20 ml of a microelement solution (Smibert and Kreig, 1994;
  Halverson and Firestone, 2000).
  Propagation of Plants and Collection of
  Root Exudates
  B. distachyon Bd21 was established from seed material obtained
  from the USDA-ARS Plant Germplasm Introduction and Testing
  Research Unit (Pullman, WA, United States). Brachypodium
  seeds were imbibed for 3 days at 4 C and sown in 7   7 cm
  pots filled with Sunshine Potting Mix #4 (Sun Gro Horticulture,
  Agawam, MA, United States). Plants were grown in an IR-
  89X (Percival Scientific, Perry, IA, United States) controlled
  environment chamber retrofitted with 6500K and 3000K T5 54W
  grow lights (Spectralux) under a 20-h light, 24 C/4-h dark, 18 C
  cycle. Plants were watered and fertilized with Jack’s professional
  water-soluble fertilizer (20:20:20) (JR Peters, Allentown, PA,
  United States). After 12 weeks and plant senescence, seeds
  were collected, processed, and stored under desiccant and dark
  conditions at room temperature.
  To collect root exudates, seeds of B. distachyon Bd21 were
  surface-sterilized, pregerminated, and placed in sterile 1 L widemouth
  glass jars containing 113 g of 6-mm glass beads and
  25 ml distilled water. Jars were covered with vented caps
  and plants were grown hydroponically in an environmental
  controlled growth chamber under conditions described above.
  After 6 days, root exudates were extracted from individual
  jars and their sterility was confirmed by spotting on nutrient
  agar. Multiple batches of root exudates were collected, filtered
  (0.22 mm), aliquoted in Falcon tubes (10 ml), lyophilized, and
  stored at –80 C.
  Metabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates
  Exudates were analyzed for primary metabolites at the Murdock
  Metabolomics Laboratory at Washington State University
  (Pullman, WA, United States). Freeze-dried residues were
  suspended in 500 ml 50% aqueous acetonitrile and clarified by
  centrifugation for 20 min at 21,000   g and 4 C. The liquid
  chromatography mass spectrometry analysis was conducted
  with a Synapt G2-S quadrupole-ion mobility spectrometrytime
  of flight mass spectrometer system equipped with an
  acquity ultra-performance liquid chromatograph (UPLC) and
  an acquity photodiode array detector (all from Waters, Milford,
  MA, United States). The exudate metabolites were separated
  on a SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC HPLC column (2.1   100 mm,
  3 mm) (Milllipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, United States) using
  acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid as solvent B and water
  with 0.1% formic acid as solvent A at a flow rate of 400 ml
  min􀀀1 and the following linear gradient extending over 14 min:
  0 min, 80% B; 4 min, 80% B, 6 min: 10% B; 7.5 min, 10%
  B; 10 min, 80% B; and 14 min, 80% B. Mass spectra were
  collected in positive ion mode over a range of m/z 50–1,200
  with a scan time of 0.2 s. The Q-TOF-MS source was at
  3.0 kV and 120 C; the sampling cone at 40 V, desolvation
  temperature was 250 C; cone gas and desolvation gas flow were
  at 0 and 850 L h􀀀1, respectively. Leucine enkephalin was used
  for post-acquisition mass correction. Target compounds were
  visualized using selected ion chromatograms at 0.05 Da window
  width. The compound identification was based on comparison
  of chromatographic behavior and accurate masses to those of
  authentic standards.
  For gas chromatography, derivatization was carried out using
  a modification of the procedure of Lee and Fiehn (2008).
  The freeze-dried residues were suspended in 950 ml aqueous
  methanol (84%, v/v) and clarified by centrifugation for 15 min
  at 21,000   g at 4 C. The supernatants were spiked with 1
  mg of the internal standard salicylic acid-d6 (C/D/N Isotopes,
  Quebec, Canada) and dried in vacuo. The dry residues were
  suspended in 10 ml of O-methoxylamine hydrochloride (30 mg
  ml􀀀1 in anhydrous pyridine, both from Millipore Sigma) and
  incubated while mixing (1,000 RPM) for 90 min at 30 C.
  Subsequently, samples were derivatized with 90 ml of MSTFA
  with 1% TMCS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,
  United States) for 30 min at 37 C. Gas chromatography-mass
  spectroscopy analysis was performed using a Pegasus 4D timeof-
  flight mass spectrometer (LECO, Saint Joseph MI) equipped
  with a MPS2 autosampler (Gerstel, Linthicum, MD) and a 7890A
  oven (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States).
  The derivatization products were separated on a 30-m, 0.25 mm
  i.d., 0.25 mm df Rxi-5Sil column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA,
  United States) with an IntegraGuard precolumn using ultrapure
  He at a constant flow of 0.9 ml min􀀀1 as carrier gas. The linear
  thermal gradient started with a 1-min hold at 70 C, followed
  by a ramp to 300 C at 10 C min􀀀1. The final temperature was
  held for 5 min prior to returning to initial conditions. Mass
  spectra were collected at 17 spectra s􀀀1. Peak identification was
  conducted using the Fiehn primary metabolite library (Kind
  et al., 2009) and an identity score cutoff of 700. Additionally,
  authentic standards for a number of primary metabolites were
  analyzed under identical conditions and the data used to compare
  the chromatographic behavior. Peak alignment and spectrum
  comparisons were carried out using the Statistical Compare
  feature of ChromaTOF software (LECO).

  Mavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome
  Isolation of RNA From Bacteria Cultured
  in Root Exudates and RNA-Seq
  The strains were pregrown overnight at 25 C on 21C-glucose
  agar and then subcultured into 96-well microplates containing
  liquid 21C-glucose medium amended with Brachypodium
  exudates. The liquid medium was prepared by dissolving the
  lyophilized root exudate material in an appropriate volume of
  21C-glucose medium to concentrate root exudates 20-fold. The
  growth medium was sterilized by passing it through a 0.22-
  mm membrane filter. The control cultures were grown under
  identical conditions in the absence of exudates. All treatments
  were inoculated at OD600 of 0.1 and incubated for 20 to
  22 h until cultures entered late-exponential growth phase at
  25 C in an atmosphere of 15% oxygen [created by a ProOx
  P110 oxygen controller (BioSpherix, Parish, NY, United States)
  with a hypoxia C-chamber]. The cells were stabilized by the
  addition RNAprotect reagent (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD,
  United States) and total RNA was purified using a RNeasy Protect
  Bacteria Mini Kit (QIAGEN) from three biological replicates of
  each strain cultured under control conditions and in exudates.
  The quality assessment of the extracted RNA samples was
  performed with a NanoDrop OneC Spectrophotometer (Thermo
  Fisher Scientific) and a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies)
  and revealed A260/A280 and A260/A230 values of > 2.0 and a mean
  RNA integrity numbers (RIN) value of > 9.2.
  Three biological replicates of RNA samples were shipped on
  dry ice to the DOE Joint Genome Institute (Walnut Creek, CA,
  United States), where rRNA was depleted and stranded RNASeq
  libraries were prepared, quantified by qPCR and sequenced
  using a HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina). The fastq file reads
  were filtered and processed with BBDuk1 to remove reads that
  contained 1 or more “N” bases, had an average quality score
  across the read less than 10 or had a minimum length < 51 bp
  or 33% of the full read length. Reads mapped with BBMap (see
  text footnote 2) to masked human, cat, dog, and mouse references
  at 93% identity were removed. Another category of removed
  sequences matched RNA spike-in, PhiX, common microbial
  contaminants, and ribosomal RNAs. The processed reads from
  each library were aligned to the reference genome using BBMap
  with only unique mappings allowed (BAMs/directory). If a
  read mapped to more than one location it was ignored.
  featureCounts (Liao et al., 2014) was used to generate raw
  gene counts, which were normalized to adjust for the length of
  each gene and total number of reads mapped for each library.
  The normalization formula used: n = [r/(l/1,000)]/(t/1,000,000),
  where n = normalized read count for gene (G) for library (L);
  r = raw read count for gene G for library L; l = gene G length; and
  t = total reads mapped for library L. Raw gene counts were used to
  evaluate the level of correlation between biological samples using
  Pearson’s correlation.
  Bioinformatic Analysis
  Count tables generated by the JGI RNA-Seq pipeline were input
  into DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) to normalize and determine
  1https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/
  differential expression. Statistical significance was established
  through DESeq2 by using three biological replicates for control
  and root exudate conditions. Scatterplots were generated from
  the DESeq2 data table outputs using ggplot2. Genes differentially
  expressed between control and root exudate samples (log2 foldchanges
  –2   to   2, adjusted p value   0.05) were used in
  downstream analysis. The core genome and pangenome for the
  Pseudomonas strains used in this study were computed using the
  OthoMCL v.2.0, Species Tree Builder v.2.2.0, and Phylogenetic
  Pangenome Accumulation v1.4.0 apps implemented in the U.S.
  Department of Energy Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase)
  (Arkin et al., 2018). Additional comparisons were conducted
  with the PGAweb pangenome analysis pipeline (Chen et al.,
  2018). Differentially expressed genes were assigned to core,
  non-core, and singleton parts of each strain’s proteome by
  BLASTp with an E value cutoff of e-06, identity of 40%
  and coverage of 60%. Functional annotation of differentially
  expressed genes was carried out with the Blast2GO (Conesa
  and Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al.,
  2018). Additional manual curation was performed using tools
  implemented in the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG)
  database (Markowitz et al., 2012), Pseudomonas Genome
  Database (Winsor et al., 2009), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa et al., 2008), and Geneious 10.2.3
  (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand). Metabolic functions
  encoded by the differentially expressed genes were mapped
  using iPath 3.0 (Darzi et al., 2018). Phylogenetic analyses
  were carried out by building multiple sequence alignments
  with MAFFT v7.222 (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and inferring
  neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenies with Geneious Tree Builder.
  The resultant phylogenetic trees were visualized with iTOL
  (Letunic and Bork, 2016). Reproducibility of clades within the
  inferred NJ trees was assessed by bootstrap resampling with
  1,000 replicates.
  Characterization of Carbon Source
  Utilization With Biolog Phenotype
  Microarrays
  The utilization of carbon sources was analyzed using Phenotype
  MicroArrays (Biolog, Hayward, CA, United States) as follows.
  The bacteria were cultured overnight on Luria-Bertani agar
  at 25 C, after which cells were harvested and suspended in
  inoculating fluid (IF-0). The transmittance of the suspension
  was adjusted to 42% using a Biolog turbidimeter. The cell
  suspension was mixed with IF􀀀0 containing Dye Mix A
  (Biolog) to achieve a final transmittance of 85%. One hundred
  microliter aliquots of the adjusted cell suspension were
  inoculated into PM01 and PM02A plates, which were then
  incubated in an OmniLog Phenotype MicroArray System
  (Biolog) at 25 C for 48 h. The formation of formazan was
  recorded at 15 min intervals, and data were analyzed using
  OmniLog Parametric Analysis software v1.20.02 (Biolog).
  Relative growth of the studied strains was normalized to
  growth on D-glucose and visualized using Heatmapper
  (Babicki et al., 2016).

  RESULTS
  Metabolomic Profiling of Root Exudates
  of B. distachyon
  Metabolomics analysis of lyophilized root exudates revealed
  the presence of numerous plant metabolites, 86 of which were
  identified by matching their spectra to the LECO/Fiehn
  Metabolomics library (Supplementary Table 3). These
  metabolites included (i) carbohydrates and their derivatives
  (glucose, fructose, xylose, sucrose, trehalose, maltose, galactose,
  and others); (ii) sugar alcohols (b-mannosylglycerate, myoinositol,
  galactinol, 2-deoxyerythritol, ribitol, threitol and
  cellobitol); (iii) amino acids and derivatives (glutamine,
  tyrosine, glutamic acid, asparagine, aspartic acid, valine,
  phenylalanine, isoleucine, glycine, serine, proline, leucine,
  tryptophan, cysteine, methionine, citrulline, and others); (iv)
  organic acids (aconitic, allantoic, g-aminobutyric, azelaic, citric,
  fumaric, 2-furoic, D-glyceric, 3-hydroxypropionic, a-ketoadipic,
  malic, methylmalonic, nicotinic, quinic, succinic, threonic);
  and (v) assorted metabolites including heterocyclic compounds,
  phenolics, and biogenic amines, etc (3-hydroxypyridine,
  maleimide, noradrenaline, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoate,
  5-methoxytryptamine, uracil, aminomalonic acid, palmitic acid,
  and urea). Results of the analysis also revealed that root exudates
  of B. distachyon contain hydroxyectoine and the quaternary
  amine (QA) glycine betaine (Supplementary Figure 1).
  Phylogenetic and Pangenome Analyses
  of Pseudomonas Strains Used in the
  Study
  We used a set of phylogenetic markers suggested by Mulet et al.
  (2010) to investigate the relatedness of the eight strains used in
  this study to distinct lineages recognized within the P. fluorescens
  species complex. The multilocus sequence analysis based on
  the concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S
  rRNA), gyrB, rpoB, and rpoD identified R1-43-08 (along with
  strains 2-79 and SBW25) as a member of the P. fluorescens
  subgroup (Figure 1). The rest of the strains clustered closely with
  four additional subgroups of the P. fluorescens complex, namely
  P. corrugata (strains Q2-87 and Q8r1-96), P. koreensis (Pf0-1),
  P. protegens (Pf-5), and P. chlororaphis (30–84). The genomes of
  the eight rhizosphere Pseudomonas strains varied in size by 1.43
  megabase (ranging from 5.65 to 7.07 Mb) and contained between
  5,166 and 6,363 protein-coding genes (Figure 2A). The shared
  gene content was characterized with OrthoMCL, which uses allagainst-
  all BLASTp followed by the Markov Cluster algorithm to
  identify protein groups shared between the compared genomes,
  as well as groups representing species-specific gene expansion
  families (Li et al., 2003). The pangenome analysis revealed a
  core comprised of approximately 3,179 orthologs that were
  shared among all strains and represented 50.0% to 61.5%
  of each predicted proteome (Figures 2A,B). The non-core
  pangenome contained genes shared by two or more (but not
  all) strains and contained between 1,482 and 2,080 orthologs,
  which corresponded to 28.7–36.3% of individual proteomes. The
  rest of the predicted protein-coding genes were strain-specific
  singletons that comprised 7.5% to 15.1% of the strain’s predicted
  proteomes. In respect to divergence from the core genome, strain
  Pf-5 was found to possess the highest proportion of unique genes
  (n = 949) followed by 2-79 (n = 887). The entire pangenome of
  the Pseudomonas strains encompassed over 12,000 homolog and
  singleton gene families.
  Further homolog family-based comparisons identified Q8r1-
  96 and R1-43-08 as the most distantly related strains, with
  3349 shared homologs (Supplementary Table 4A). Q8r1-96 and
  Q2-87, which shared 4,489 homologs, were the most closely
  related strains. The partitioning of homolog gene families into
  the core, non-core, and singleton parts of the pangenome agreed
  with phylogenetic relationships of the strains deduced from the
  analysis of a selected subset of COGs (Clusters of Orthologous
  Groups) (Figure 2C and Supplementary Tables 4B,C). The
  COG-based phylogeny supported the multilocus sequence
  analysis and revealed that the eight Pseudomonas strains form
  three distinct clusters, the first of which contained 2-79, R1-30-
  84, and SBW25. The second cluster included Q8r1-96 and Q2-87,
  whereas the third encompassed strains 30-84, Pf-5, and Pf0-1.
  Correlating the Composition of Root
  Exudates With Metabolic Profiles of
  Pseudomonas Strains
  We used the Phenotype MicroArray PM1 and PM2 plates to
  profile the eight Pseudomonas strains for the utilization of
  190 different carbon sources. Results of the analysis identified
  90 compounds that supported growth and clustered by their
  intensities of utilization into three distinct groups (Figure 3).
  Group I was comprised of 30 highly metabolized carbon
  sources, which included several amino acids and intermediates of
  glycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, and citrate cycle. Approximately
  half of these compounds were catabolized by all eight strains,
  and included several organic acids (fumaric, citric, gluconic,
  malic, and pyroglutamic), amino acids (Glu, Asn, Gln, Asp, Pro,
  Ala, and g-aminobutyric acid), carbohydrates (glucose, mannose,
  and mannitol), and the purine nucleoside inosine. Group II
  was composed of 44 chemically diverse carbon sources that
  were variably utilized by the strains. These compounds were
  carbohydrates, organic acids, amino acids, phenolics, and polyols,
  and included known compatible solutes and intermediates of
  metabolism of pentoses, galactose, starch, and sucrose. Group
  III encompassed the rest of the Phenotype MicroArray test
  panel and contained compounds that were not catabolized
  by the tested strains. Among several notable exceptions were
  a-hydroxyglutamic acid- g-lactone, putrescine, and itaconic,
  citramalic, and succinamic acids, which supported the growth
  of strains 2-79, 30-84, Pf-5, and SBW25. We further matched
  the carbon metabolic profiles of the Pseudomonas strains against
  the list of plant-derived metabolites from the root exudates of

  FIGURE 1 | Neighbor joining phylogeny showing the relationship of the eight strains used in this study (indicated by red triangles) to different species of the
  P. fluorescens complex. The phylogeny was established based on the concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes rrs (16S rRNA), gyrB (subunit B of DNA
  gyrase), rpoB (b subunit of RNA polymerase), and rpoD (sigma 70 factor subunit of RNA polymerase). Distance matrices were calculated by the Jukes-Cantor
  method. Colored circles on tree nodes indicate bootstrap values (1,000 replicates) that vary between 60% (smallest circle) and 100% (largest circles).
  B. distachyon Bd21. Interestingly, many carbon sources from
  the Phenotype MicroArray panel were also present in the root
  exudates of B. distachyon Bd21, and some of these compounds
  (glucose, mannose, galactose, fructose, g-aminobutyric acid,
  aspartic acid, citric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, quinic acid,
  alanine, glutamine, and glutamic acid) were catabolized by all
  strains used in this study, while others (e.g., xylose, trehalose,
  m-inositol) were actively utilized only by certain organisms
  (Figure 3). The comparison of catabolic profiles across the
  eight studied Pseudomonas strains revealed the presence of three
  distinct clusters. The first cluster contained strains Q8r1-96 and
  Q2-87, which consumed very similar sets of carbon sources,
  as well as strain Pf0-1. The second cluster was composed of
  2-79, R1-43-08, SBW25, and 30-84, whereas the third cluster
  was represented by a single strain, Pf-5. The overall similarity
  of the catabolic profiles partially agreed with the separation
  of the strains into different subgroups of the P. fluorescens
  complex (see above).
  Analysis of the RNA-seq Results
  In order to understand the cellular responses of rhizosphere
  Pseudomonas to plant exometabolites, we analyzed the
  transcriptome changes in cultures grown in the presence of
  root exudates. Under field conditions, rhizobacteria colonize
  plant roots in the form of surface-attached microaerobic biofilms
  (Hojberg et al., 1999). To mimic these conditions, the eight
  Pseudomonas strains were grown statically at 72% air saturation
  in 21C-glucose medium amended with root exudates and then
  processed to extract total RNA (Supplementary Figure 2).
  A total of 995 million raw sequencing reads were generated from
  the RNA samples by using the Illumina HiSeq-2500 platform,
  averaging 20.7 million reads per sample. The removal of lowquality
  and rRNA sequences resulted in a total of 793 million
  filtered reads that were mapped onto the eight Pseudomonas
  genomes with a mean of 7.48 million mapped fragments per
  genome. The differentially abundant transcripts were identified
  by setting a p value of 0.05 (adjusted for multiple testing) and

  25th and 75th percentiles and medians (horizontal lines) with whiskers corresponding to the 10th and 90th percentiles. The input order was randomized to avoid any
  bias due to the sequential addition of new genomes. The pangenome size increases steadily without reaching a plateau even after the addition of 11,939
  non-redundant gene families. At the same time, the core genome converged to 3,179 genes. (C) The pangenome-based phylogenomic analysis of the studied
  strains. Here, the pangenome was defined with OrthoMCL, and orthologous gene sets were then partitioned into the core, singleton, and non-core (the remaining
  ortholog sets) categories. These categories were calculated for each node in the Maximum Likelihood species tree, using the set of genomes for which that node
  represents the ancestor. The results of the ortholog partitioning are shown in pie charts placed at tree nodes. Numbers indicate bootstrap support values. The
  analysis was conducted in KBase (Arkin et al., 2018).
  the log2 fold-change (FC) threshold    2.0 (Figure 4 and
  Supplementary Tables 5–12). When compared with the control
  conditions, an average of 204 genes per strain were differentially
  expressed in the presence of root exudates, with the highest
  (n = 425) and lowest (n = 112) numbers observed, respectively,
  in SBW25 and Q2-87 (Figure 4). Overall, more genes were
  induced than repressed in response to exudates, but the actual
  numbers in each category varied substantially depending on the
  identity of the Pseudomonas strain. In most strains, the bulk of
  the differentially expressed genes was almost equally distributed
  between the core (mean, 48.2%) and non-core (mean, 45.8%)
  parts of the genome, whereas the strain-specific singleton genes
  constituted on average only 5.9% (Figure 4B). One notable
  exception was observed in Q8r1-96, where all differentially
  expressed genes belonged to the core (73.8%) and non-core
  (26.2%) parts of the genome. Another notable pattern was
  observed in R1-43-08, where the majority of genes affected by
  the presence of root exudate fell into the non-core category
  (56.3%). The highest proportion of differentially expressed
  singletons (11.3 and 10.4%, respectively) was identified in
  strains SBW25 and Pf-5.
  We further explored how the identified differentially
  expressed genes were distributed across genomes of the eight
  studied rhizosphere strains. The pairwise BLASTp comparisons
  identified 2-79 and SBW25 as two strains that shared the highest
  number of genes (n = 101) induced or repressed in response
  to root exudates (Table 1). The second pair of strains with
  a significant number of similar differentially expressed genes
  (n = 86) was Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, which was followed by Pf0-1
  and 30-84, which shared 56 differentially expressed genes. These
  patterns of shared genes were also observed when the results of
  the pairwise BLASTp comparisons were converted into a binary
  gene presence/absence matrix, which was then subjected to
  cluster analysis using a UPGMA algorithm based on Sorensen’s
  dissimilarity index or examined by non-metric multidimensional
  scaling (NMDS) (Figure 5).
  The differentially expressed Pseudomonas genes were
  subjected to Blast2Go analysis and Gene Ontology (GO)
  annotation (Figure 6). Metabolic process, catalytic activity,
  and membrane were the most common annotation terms
  across the three primary GO term categories (i.e., biological
  process, molecular function, and cellular component). A total
  of 1,694 GO terms was assigned to 805 upregulated genes, with
  the majority of the GO terms related to molecular function
  (682, 40.3%), followed by biological process (669, 39.5%), and
  cellular component (343, 20.2%). In the 539 downregulated gene
  category, 1,101 GO terms were assigned to biological process
  (420, 38.1%), molecular function (417, 37.9%), and cellular
  component (264, 24.0%). Within biological process, metabolic
  process, cellular process, localization, response to stimulus, and
  regulation were over-represented. Within molecular function,
  the largest proportion was assigned to catalytic activity, binding,
  and transporter activity categories. Within cellular component,
  the majority were assigned to membrane, membrane part, cell,
  and cell part categories. Across the eight strains, 37–42% of
  differentially expressed genes had no Gene Ontology IDs and
  encoded various conserved hypothetical proteins.
  Functional Classification of Shared
  Differentially Expressed Genes
  The interrogation of RNA-seq data revealed multiple cellular
  pathways that were differentially regulated in bacterial cultures
  incubated with root exudates (Supplementary Figures 3, 4).

  FIGURE 3 | Biolog Phenotype MicroArray profiling the eight rhizosphere
  Pseudomonas strains used in the study. The hierarchical clustering analysis
  was carried out using the average linkage method with Euclidean distances.
  Carbon sources identified by red arrowheads were also detected in the sterile
  root exudates of B. distachyon Bd21.
  Although none of these differentially regulated pathways were
  shared by all eight strains, the cross-strain comparisons revealed
  several types of common and specific transcriptomic responses
  that were elicited by the presence of plant exometabolites
  (Table 2). The visual representation of core gene expression
  patterns is provided in Supplementary Figure 5, which
  shows heatmaps of expression profiles and p-adj values for
  core genes shared by the studied strains. The figure is
  accompanied by Supplementary Table 13 that lists predicted
  functions of genes constituting the four distinct clusters
  observed after hierarchical clustering of gene expression
  values. The first category of shared differentially expressed
  pathways functioned in the uptake and catabolism of selected
  carbohydrates, quaternary ammonium compounds (QAs), and
  phenolics. All strains except for R1-43-08, responded to root
  exudates by inducing the fructose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate
  (PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTSFru). The
  components of this system are encoded by a conserved
  operon and include the cytoplasmic polyprotein EI/HPr/EIIAFru
  (FruB), the 1-phosphofructokinase FruK, and the fructosespecific
  permease EIIBC (FruA) (Chavarria et al., 2016). The
  PTSFru system functions by acquiring high-energy phosphates
  from PEP and sequentially passing them, via the EI/HPr/EIIAFru
  domains of FruB, to the EIIB component of FruA. The
  phosphates are ultimately transferred by the EIIC transporter
  to fructose yielding fructose 1-phosphate, which is channeled
  into the central metabolic pathways through the action of the
  phosphofructokinase FruK.
  In all strains except for Q8r1-96 and Pf-5, the exposure to root
  exudates resulted in the induction of two genes adjacent to the
  fru cluster that encoded a Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS)
  transporter and an L-arabinonate dehydratase (Table 2). These
  genes are predicted to participate in the uptake and catabolism
  of L-arabinose, where L-arabinonate dehydratase plays an
  important role by converting L-arabinonate to 2-dehydro-3-
  deoxy-L-arabinonate (Rahman et al., 2017). In SBW25, R1-
  43-08, and Q2-87, we also observed the induction of genes
  encoding components of the AraFGH complex, an ATP-Binding
  Cassette (ABC) superfamily transporter involved in the import of
  arabinose into the cell (Supplementary Tables 6, 7, 9). Finally, all
  strains except SBW25 and R1-43-08 responded to the presence
  of exudates by upregulating a conserved gene encoding an
  aldose epimerase superfamily protein. Such enzymes equilibrate
  alpha- and beta-anomers of aldoses and ensure that stereospecific
  enzymes involved in the metabolism of free sugars do not act as
  metabolic bottlenecks (Abayakoon et al., 2018). Although some
  aldose epimerases have been linked to specific pathways, the
  Pseudomonas gene identified in this study could not be assigned
  to a particular metabolic process based on sequence analysis and
  genomic location.
  Several Pseudomonas strains responded to the presence
  of root exudates by upregulating genes involved in the
  uptake and catabolism of myo-inositol and possibly other
  stereoisomers of inositol (Table 2). The upregulated catabolic
  genes encode the dehydrogenase IolG, which oxidizes myoinositol
  to its corresponding ketone, as well as IolE, IolD, IolB,
  and IolC that collectively convert the 2-keto-myo-inositol to
  acetyl-CoA and the glycolysis intermediate dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate (Yoshida et al., 2008; Kohler et al., 2011). In R1-
  43-08, Q8r1-96, Q2-87, and Pf-5, the upregulated functions

  also involved components of the putative inositol-specific
  ABC transporter. The cross-genome comparisons revealed
  that in all studied strains except for Pf0-1, components
  of the myo-inositol utilization pathway were encoded
  within a well-conserved gene cluster which, in addition to
  catabolic and transport functions, also encodes a dedicated
  transcriptional repressor.

  sarcosine from the environment. Many of these genes were
  differentially expressed, including those encoding parts of the
  ABC transporter CbcXWV, which is predicted to function in
  the uptake of choline under water-replete conditions (Table 2).
  Among enzymes induced in the presence of root exudates were
  the choline dehydrogenase BetA, which converts choline to
  glycine betaine and a network of enzymes (i.e., the Rieske family
  oxygenase GbcAB, the dimethyglycine demethylase DgcAB, and
  the sarcosine oxidase SoxBDAG) that sequentially convert GB
  to glycine. In 2-79 and SBW25, this group of differentially
  regulated genes also included an AraC-family transcriptional
  activator GbdR, which perceives intercellular levels of GB and
  induces genes involved in the transport and catabolism of
  glycine betaine and detoxification of the catabolic byproducts
  (Hampel et al., 2014).
  The last category of activated catabolic pathways included the
  catechol branch of the b-ketoadipate pathway for the degradation
  of aromatic compounds. In strains 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5,
  growth on root exudates resulted in upregulation of catechol-
  1,2-dioxygenase, muconate cycloisomerase, and muconolactone
  isomerase, which collectively cleave the catechol ring and
  convert it to b-ketoadipate enol-lactone (Harwood and Parales,
  1996). Finally, analysis of the P. synxantha 2-79 transcriptome
  identified an induction of benABC genes encoding subunits
  of benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase, an oxidoreductase that generates
  catechol from benzoate.
  In addition to various catabolic pathways, the exposure to root
  exudates also induced several genes involved in the homeostasis
  of copper (Table 2). Four of these genes form a conserved cluster
  in genomes of the strains and encode the periplasmic coppersensing
  two-component system CinRS, the plastocyanin/azurinlike
  protein CinA, and the NADPH-dependent pre-Q0 reductase
  CinQ. Also, in strains Q2-87, 30-84, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, we observed
  upregulation of a conserved operon encoding the multicopper
  oxidase CopA, the periplasmic copper-binding protein CopC, the
  inner membrane protein CopD, and outer membrane protein
  CopB. In several Gram-negative bacteria, these Cop proteins are
  thought to have dual functions and participate both in the uptake
  of essential copper as well as in the sequestration of excess copper
  in the periplasm and outer membrane.
  The analysis of shared downregulated pathways revealed that
  most of the strains respond to the presence of root exudates by
  repressing genes involved in the uptake and catabolism of sulfur
  compounds (Table 2). In strains SBW25, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96,
  Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, this response involved the ssuEADCB
  operon responsible for the utilization of alkanesulfonates
  as sulfur sources. The ssu operon is highly conserved in
  fluorescent pseudomonads and encodes the FMNH2-dependent
  monooxygenase SsuD and the NAD (P)H-dependent FMN
  reductase SsuE, which together catalyze the desulfonation of
  alkanesulfonates. Also, the ssu locus contains genes for the
  molybdopterin-binding protein SsuF and the alkanesulfonatespecific
  ABC-type transporter consisting of the sulfonate
  substrate-binding protein SsuA, sulfonate permease protein
  SsuC, and sulfonate transport ATP-binding protein SsuB. Finally,
  in R1-43-08, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5, growth on root exudates
  coincided with repression of the tauABCD operon, which
  allows these strains to utilize taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonate)
  as a sulfur source. The repressed tau genes encoded the
  2-oxoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenase TauD and
  substrate-binding, ATP-binding, and permease components of
  the taurine-specific ABC transporter TauABC.
  Other Differentially Expressed Pathways
  In addition to their effect on several shared cellular pathways,
  growth on root exudates resulted in the induction or repression of
  numerous strain-specific genes. In closely related P. synxantha 2-
  79 and P. fluorescens SBW25, we observed differential expression
  of genes involved in energy metabolism, transport of amino
  acids, and surface attachment (Supplementary Tables 5, 6).
  Other notable differentially expressed pathways included 2–
  79 gene clusters that encode enzymes for the catabolism of
  trehalose, a prophage, and toxin/antitoxin system, as well as the
  SBW25 operon predicted to control the synthesis of the capsular
  exopolysaccharide colonic acid. The response of Pseudomonas sp.
  R1-43-08 to root exudates also involved differential expression
  of different energy metabolism pathways. In addition, we
  observed the upregulation of genes involved in the uptake and
  catabolism of xylose (also upregulated in 2–79) and repression
  of enzymes for the biosynthesis of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid
  and assimilation of inorganic sulfur and L-cysteine biosynthesis
  (Supplementary Table 7).
  The analysis of the Q8r1-96 transcriptome revealed
  perturbation of different metabolic pathways including genes
  encoding components of cytochrome C oxidase, transport
  and catabolism of sorbitol/mannitol, metabolism of butanoic
  acid, and biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides alginate and
  poly-b-1-6-N-acetylglucosamine (Supplementary Table 8). In
  P. fluorescens Q2-87, we identified differential expression of
  genes involved in metabolism of galactose, tryptophan, tyrosine,
  glycine, serine, and threonine (Supplementary Table 9),
  while in P. chlororaphis 30-84, growth on exudates activated
  the biosynthesis of molybdopterin cofactor, catabolism of
  galactonate and acetoin, and uptake and catabolism of putrescine
  (Supplementary Table 10). The response of P. protegens Pf-5 to
  root exudates involved upregulation of acetoin dehydrogenase,
  which converts acetoin to acetaldehyde and acetyl-CoA, as

  and Gotz, 2008) and visualized in WEGO 2.0 (Ye et al., 2018). On a WEGO histogram, the percentage of 100 is defined as the total number of genes assigned a GO
  term. However, the subcategories do not add up to 100% because many genes fall into more than one functional class and are therefore annotated by multiple GO
  terms.
  well as pathways for the utilization of glycolate and putrescine
  (Supplementary Table 11). Also induced were genes for
  the production of pyrrolnitrin and PhlG hydrolase, which
  modulate the metabolic loads attributed to the synthesis of
  2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol. The differentially expressed genes of
  P. fluorescens Pf0-1 included, among others, operons encoding
  cytochrome C oxidase and enzymes for catabolism of malonic
  acid (Supplementary Table 12). Yet another interesting
  finding involved the induction of assorted genes acting in the
  homeostasis of iron and defense against reactive oxygen species
  (ROS). We observed activation of iron dicitrate transporters
  (SBW25 and 30-84), genes for the biosynthesis of siderophores
  ornicorrugatin (SBW25) and pyochelin (Pf-5), heme-degrading
  enzymes (2–79, 30–84), TonB siderophore receptors, and
  components of the energy-transducing inner membrane
  complex TonB-ExbB-ExbD (2–79 and Pf-5). The differentially
  expressed ROS defense pathways were represented by different
  catalases in strains 2–79, R1-43-08, Q8r1-96, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and
  Pf-5 and organic hydroperoxide resistance proteins in strains
  SBW25 and R1-43-08. Finally, in SBW25, Q2-87, 30–84, and
  Pf0-1, the addition of exudates resulted in the upregulation of
  peroxiredoxins that detoxify H2O2, peroxynitrite, and aliphatic
  and aromatic hydroperoxides.

  Mavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome
  soil microorganisms. Our results were in agreement with a
  recent report of 27 different sugars, amino acids, and organic
  acids in Brachypodium exudates (Kawasaki et al., 2016). We
  confirmed the presence of exometabolites identified in that
  study, along with dozens of additional analytes that were
  identified by matching their mass-spectra and retention indices
  to the LECO/Fiehn Metabolomics library (Supplementary
  Table 3). The complementation of the metabolomic analysis
  with profiling of the bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays
  revealed that a substantial proportion of the characterized
  exudate constituents were catabolized by a collection of eight
  Pseudomonas strains from across the P. fluorescens group that is
  known to form associations with plant roots. The amendment
  of Pseudomonas cultures with root exudates caused changes in
  the expression of multiple genes encoding catabolic and anabolic
  enzymes, predicted transporters, transcriptional regulators, stress
  response, and conserved hypothetical proteins. In most strains,
  these differentially expressed genes were almost equally split
  between the core and variable genome regions, mirroring
  the substantial strain-to-strain variation in the genome size
  and gene content within the P. fluorescens species complex
  (Loper et al., 2012).
  The analysis of transcriptome responses to root exudates
  revealed several types of cellular pathways present in the strains
  used in this study. The first category of such pathways was
  involved in the catabolism of carbohydrates such as fructose,
  arabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, trehalose, and galactose. Among
  these catabolic traits, the ability to utilize fructose as a carbon
  source is highly conserved among fluorescent pseudomonads.
  In contrast, growth on arabinose, myo-inositol, xylose, and
  trehalose is variably present and was traditionally used to
  differentiate species and biovars within the P. fluorescens
  group (Barrett et al., 1986). We speculate that such variably
  distributed pathways contribute to the differential affinity of
  pseudomonads toward host plants and/or to determine which
  strains flourish in response to growing roots and changing
  environments. Several independent studies have confirmed
  the importance of carbohydrate catabolism pathways for the
  biology of rhizosphere pseudomonads. For example, in vivo
  expression technology (IVET) profiling of P. fluorescens SBW25
  identified xylose isomerase among genome regions essential
  for the colonization of sugar beet seedlings (Liu et al., 2015),
  whereas a genome-wide Tn-Seq screen of Pseudomonas simiae
  identified genes for the catabolism of myo-inositol among traits
  essential for the colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana roots
  (Cole et al., 2017).
  The response of rhizosphere Pseudomonas to Brachypodium
  root exudates also involved pathways for the uptake and
  metabolism of amino acids. We observed differential
  expression of genes encoding the hydrophobic (HAAT) and
  polar (PAAT) amino acid uptake transporters in strains
  2-79, SBW25, Q2-87, Pf0-1, and Pf-5. Other related genes
  encoded enzymes for the catabolism of valine and glutamic
  acid (2-79); metabolism of tryptophan, glycine, serine, and
  threonine (Q2-87); and biosynthesis of methionine (Q8r1-
  96). It is plausible that the abundance of amino acids in
  root exudates is also linked to the repression of pathways
  involved in the catabolism of sulfonates and taurine that
  was observed in several strains (Table 2). Although the
  preferred source of sulfur for P. fluorescens is unknown, in the
  closely related P. aeruginosa, the sulfur starvation response
  is triggered by the growth on any sulfur compound other
  than sulfate, thiocyanate, and cysteine (Hummerjohann et al.,
  1998). This fact, together with the presence of cysteine and
  cystine in the root exudates, suggest that root exudates of
  Brachypodium may serve as an important source of sulfur for
  rhizosphere Pseudomonas. These findings also agree well with
  the reported scarcity of inorganic sulfate in the soil, and the
  presence of sulfur mostly in the form of organic compounds,
  including amino acids, proteins, sulfate esters, and sulfonates
  (Autry and Fitzgerald, 1990).
  Another interesting result of this study was the concerted
  activation of copper and iron homeostasis pathways observed
  in all of the Pseudomonas strains used in this work. In bacteria,
  an excess of copper is toxic and triggers oxidative stress due to
  the formation of free radicals, as well as disruption of protein
  metalation and stability of iron-sulfur clusters (Bondarczuk
  and Piotrowska-Seget, 2013). On the other hand, copper is an
  essential trace element used as a cofactor in different enzymes.
  Similarly, although elevated levels of iron cause redox stress, this
  element is also found in active energy metabolism enzymes and is
  crucial for bacterial growth (Andrews et al., 2003). The analysis
  of metal homeostasis genes identified in this study suggests
  that their induction was likely triggered by the deficiency of
  copper and iron in bacterial cultures grown in the presence of
  root exudates. We attribute this effect to the ability of some
  components of root exudates to chelate soil metals.
  Despite the abundance of iron in the soil, its bioavailability
  is limited due to the low solubility of Fe (III) oxyhydrates
  at neutral pH. The non-graminaceous plants circumvent this
  problem by acidifying the rhizosphere and secreting flavins,
  phenolics, and organic acids that chelate iron. The reduction
  of these ferric chelates releases soluble ferrous iron taken up
  by root cells (Kobayashi and Nishizawa, 2012). Graminaceous
  plants, like Brachypodium, acquire iron by secreting into the
  soil non-protein amino acids of the mugineic acid (MA) group,
  which act as Fe (III)-chelating phytosiderophores. In addition to
  iron, low-molecular-weight organic acids and phytosiderophores
  bind other divalent and trivalent metals (including copper) and
  contribute to heavy-metal tolerance in plants (Chen et al., 2017).
  It is plausible that the presence of these plant exometabolites
  is responsible for the deficit of iron and copper observed in
  Pseudomonas cultures grown in the presence of root exudates.
  These results further underscore the importance of diverse and
  redundant metal homeostasis pathways found in genomes of the
  P. fluorescens group for the ability of these organisms to colonize
  and persist in the plant rhizosphere.
  Recently, Klonowska et al. (2018) examined transcriptomic
  responses of symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria to root
  exudates of the legume plant Mimosa pundica, which has
  an unusual ability to support both alpha- (Rhizobium) and
  beta-rhizobia (Cupriavidus and Burkholderia). Using RNA-seq,
  the authors characterized genes involved in the perception of
  root exudates in the nodulating bacteria Burkholderia phymatum
  Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 14 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 651282
  Mavrodi et al. The Effect of Root Exudates on the Pseudomonas Transcriptome
  STM815, Cupriavidus taiwanensis LMG19424, and Rhizobium
  mesoamericanum STM3625. Interestingly, the analysis of
  differentially expressed genes revealed induction of pathways
  involved in the catabolism of fructose, xylose, myo-inositol,
  and protocatechuate/catechol. Also upregulated were some
  copper homeostasis, siderophore biosynthesis, and oxidative
  stress genes. Finally, the analytical profiling of M. pundica
  exudates revealed an overlap with Brachypodium in the types of
  carbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids present. These
  findings suggest that differentially expressed genes shared by
  multiple strains of the group P. fluorescens are not unique to
  the Brachypodium-Pseudomonas system but represent a set
  of conserved cellular pathways involved in the perception of
  plant exometabolites by different clades of rhizosphere-dwelling
  Proteobacteria.
  Most strains included in this study were originally selected
  based on the ability to colonize the rhizosphere and produce
  secondary metabolites that alleviate the plant stress response
  and/or inhibit soilborne pathogens. It has been suggested
  that plant metabolites released into the rhizosphere affect
  the biocontrol activity of plant-beneficial pseudomonads (de
  Werra et al., 2011). We provide further support to this
  hypothesis by demonstrating that in some strains, root exudates
  modulate the expression of genes for the catabolism of
  the plant growth-promoting metabolites acetoin and 2,3-
  butanediol. The exposure to exudates also affected the expression
  of genes for the synthesis of well-characterized antifungal
  compounds pyrrolnitrin, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, and 2,4-
  diacetylphloroglucinol. The modulatory effects were strainspecific,
  suggesting significant differences in the regulatory
  networks involved in the perception of plant signals and
  regulation of the production of antibiotics and growthpromoting
  metabolites.
  The final significant finding of this study was the induction
  of catabolism of quaternary amines (QAs) observed in multiple
  strains of the P. fluorescens group during growth on root
  exudates. This observation was supported by the detection of
  glycine betaine in the root secretions of B. distachyon. The
  presence of QAs in plant tissues and the capacity of these
  metabolites to provide stress protection and nutrients to plant
  pathogens and symbionts were reported before (Boncompagni
  et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2013; Kabbadj et al., 2017), but our
  study is among the first to highlight the potential importance of
  these metabolites for rhizosphere interactions. Pseudomonads do
  not synthesize QAs de novo but have evolved many pathways to
  scavenge them from eukaryotic hosts, where these metabolites
  are abundant due to the prominence of phosphatidylcholine
  in cellular membranes. Strains of P. fluorescens carry genes
  for the conversion of choline, carnitine, and glycine betaine to
  glycine, as well as quaternary amine transporters of the BCCT
  and ABC families that are also conserved in the opportunistic
  human pathogen P. aeruginosa and the plant pathogen P. syringae
  (Galvao et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2013; Wargo, 2013b).
  In P. aeruginosa, choline catabolism genes are essential for
  the ability of this pathogen to persist during lung infection
  (Wargo, 2013a). Similarly, a P. syringae mutant deficient in
  BetT, OpuC, and CbcXWV quaternary amine transporters had
  reduced fitness during colonization of bean and soybean leaves
  under greenhouse and field conditions (Chen et al., 2013).
  Depending on water availability, P. aeruginosa and P. syringae
  catabolize exogenously supplied QAs as carbon and nitrogen
  sources or accumulate them as osmoprotectants (Chen et al.,
  2013; Wargo, 2013b). Our ongoing work in P. synxantha 2–
  79 unraveled similar physiological responses and demonstrated
  that QA transporters function differentially and redundantly
  in the uptake of quaternary amines as nutrients (Pablo and
  Mavrodi, unpublished). In contrast, under water stress, the QAs
  choline, betaine, and carnitine are accumulated preferentially for
  osmoprotection. Under drought stress, a 2–79 mutant devoid
  of all known QA transporters was less competitive in the
  colonization of the Brachypodium rhizosphere than its wild-type
  parental strain. Interestingly, our metabolomic profiling of root
  exudates also revealed proline, glutamine, and hydroxyectoine.
  These metabolites act as compatible solutes in different groups
  of microorganisms (Yancey et al., 1982; Empadinhas and da
  Costa, 2008), suggesting an important role of root exudates
  in the ability of Pseudomonas to persist in the rhizosphere of
  drought-stressed plants.

  experiments: The experiment aimed to examine the molecular communication between beneficial rhizosphere bacteria (Pseudomonas spp.) and their host plant (Brachypodium distachyon). Researchers collected root exudates from B. distachyon by growing surface-sterilized plants hydroponically in sterile jars filled with glass beads and distilled water in a controlled environment (20-hour light at 24°C, 4-hour dark at 18°C). Root exudates were extracted, sterilized with 0.22 µm filtration, lyophilized, and stored at –80°C. The composition of the collected root exudates was analyzed via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). For LC-MS, a Synapt G2-S quadrupole-ion mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometer and an Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatograph (UPLC) with photodiode array detection were used, while GC-MS analysis was performed with a Pegasus 4D time-of-flight mass spectrometer coupled to an Agilent 7890A GC. Sixty-day-old cultures of eight Pseudomonas fluorescens-group strains were grown on medium amended with Brachypodium root exudates under controlled microaerobic (15% O2) conditions. Differential gene expression in response to root exudates was assessed using transcriptomics (RNA-seq), with RNA samples depleted of rRNA prior to stranded library preparation and sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Metabolic capabilities of these Pseudomonas strains were further characterized using Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays (PM01 and PM2A plates), incubated in an OmniLog Phenotype MicroArray System at 25°C for 48 hours to profile the catabolism of diverse carbon sources. Optical density and colorimetric respiration data (formazan production, absorbance detection at 590 nm) were collected every 15 minutes. Each experiment had three biological replicates. Analysis of Biolog data was performed using OmniLog Parametric Analysis software v1.20.02. For transcriptomic data, DESeq2 and various comparative genomic tools (e.g., OrthoMCL, COG-based phylogeny) were used to identify differentially expressed genes and functional annotations. Data collection and incubations lasted for 20-22 hours at 25°C. The experimental analyses revealed changes in gene expression associated with plant metabolite catabolism, transport, stress responses (e.g., oxidative and metal stresses), biocontrol activities, and suggested the importance of root-secreted osmoprotectants for bacterial rhizosphere colonization.

  Text:
  The experiment aimed to examine the molecular communication between beneficial rhizosphere bacteria (Pseudomonas spp.) and their host plant (Brachypodium distachyon). Researchers collected root exudates from B. distachyon by growing surface-sterilized plants hydroponically in sterile jars filled with glass beads and distilled water in a controlled environment (20-hour light at 24°C, 4-hour dark at 18°C). Root exudates were extracted, sterilized with 0.22 µm filtration, lyophilized, and stored at –80°C. The composition of the collected root exudates was analyzed via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). For LC-MS, a Synapt G2-S quadrupole-ion mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometer and an Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatograph (UPLC) with photodiode array detection were used, while GC-MS analysis was performed with a Pegasus 4D time-of-flight mass spectrometer coupled to an Agilent 7890A GC. Sixty-day-old cultures of eight Pseudomonas fluorescens-group strains were grown on medium amended with Brachypodium root exudates under controlled microaerobic (15% O2) conditions. Differential gene expression in response to root exudates was assessed using transcriptomics (RNA-seq), with RNA samples depleted of rRNA prior to stranded library preparation and sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Metabolic capabilities of these Pseudomonas strains were further characterized using Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays (PM01 and PM2A plates), incubated in an OmniLog Phenotype MicroArray System at 25°C for 48 hours to profile the catabolism of diverse carbon sources. Optical density and colorimetric respiration data (formazan production, absorbance detection at 590 nm) were collected every 15 minutes. Each experiment had three biological replicates. Analysis of Biolog data was performed using OmniLog Parametric Analysis software v1.20.02. For transcriptomic data, DESeq2 and various comparative genomic tools (e.g., OrthoMCL, COG-based phylogeny) were used to identify differentially expressed genes and functional annotations. Data collection and incubations lasted for 20-22 hours at 25°C. The experimental analyses revealed changes in gene expression associated with plant metabolite catabolism, transport, stress responses (e.g., oxidative and metal stresses), biocontrol activities, and suggested the importance of root-secreted osmoprotectants for bacterial rhizosphere colonization.
