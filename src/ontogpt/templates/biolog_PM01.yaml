          prompt: >-
            Extract a list of brief descriptions of experiments
            described in the paper. This list must be semicolon-delimited.
            For each description, include all of the following details if
            provided: experiment motivation (why it was performed),
            experiment design (how it was performed, including methods,
            tools, organisms, and chemicals used), environment (the location
            and conditions in which the experiment occurred, including
            metrics like temperature), all organisms used and their
            high-level type (e.g., plant, animal), the biological system
            under study (e.g., rhizosphere), experimental conditions
            (temperature, pH, etc.), and experimental factors tested or measured.
            Also note whether the experiment is a Biolog experiment and if so,
            the type or subtype of experiment (e.g., Phenotype MicroArray),
            the Biolog plates used (e.g., PM01), the number of replicates, all
            key steps in the experimental protocol, the types of data collected
            by the plate reader (e.g., OD, respiration), the protocol for
            measuring optical density (e.g., OD600 measured every 2 hours), 
            the protocol for measuring respiration (e.g., Colorimetric change
            at 590 nm for formazan detection), the instrument or equipment used
            (e.g., OmniLog Phenotype MicroArray System), the software used for
            data analysis (e.g., OmniLog Parametric Analysis software), the
            incubation temperature (e.g., 25°C), the total duration of incubation
            (e.g., 48 h), and any other relevant details.
