        description: >-
          A list of relationships between nutrients and
          biochemical diseases.
        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            A semicolon-separated list of relationships
            between a single nutrient (including vitamins,
            minerals, and micronutrients) and a single
            disease, with a type of relationship connecting
            them both. A disease is any abnormal health condition
            (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus,
            rheumatoid arthritis, sickle cell anemia, Barth syndrome).
            Represent the relationship as
            triples, e.g., "Nutrient HAS RELATIONSHIP WITH
            Disease". Relationships may include TREATS,
            PREVENTS, INCREASES RISK OF, DECREASES RISK OF,
            or others.
            If the relationship is explicitly negated, precede the
            relationship with "NOT", e.g., "NOT Nutrient HAS RELATIONSHIP
            WITH Disease".
            For each relationship, include the number of the
            corresponding reference(s) in parentheses after the
            relationship; e.g., if the text indicates a reference
            of (3), include it after the object in the relationship,
            e.g., "Subject HAS RELATIONSHIP WITH Object (3)". Delimit
            multiple references with commas, e.g., "(3, 4)".
            Do not include newlines.
            For each relationship, include the exact full sentence describing the
            relationship from the source text in pipe symbols after the
            references, e.g., "(3) [Vitamin D deficiency increases risk of
            multiple sclerosis]." Do not change or summarize the sentence.
            If the relationship is described in multiple sentences,
            create a separate, pipe delimited entry for each sentence.

        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            A semicolon-separated list of relationships
            between a single nutrient (including vitamins,
            minerals, and micronutrients) and a single
            biological phenotype, with a type of relationship
            connecting them both. A phenotype is an observable
            physical or behavioral trait or symptom (e.g., fever,
            headache, short attention span, petechiae,
            telangiectasia). It may or may not be associated
            with a disease. Phenotypes do NOT include high-level
            biological processes such as "Insulin signaling" or "lipid
            metabolism", developmental processes such as "limb development",
            or health states such as "healthy teeth". Represent the
            relationship as triples, e.g., "Nutrient HAS RELATIONSHIP
            WITH Phenotype". Relationships may include TREATS,
            PREVENTS, or others.
            If the relationship is explicitly negated, precede the
            relationship with "NOT", e.g., "NOT Nutrient HAS RELATIONSHIP
            WITH Phenotype".
            For each relationship, include the number of the
            corresponding reference(s) in parentheses after the
            relationship; e.g., if the text indicates a reference
            of (3), include it after the object in the relationship,
            e.g., "Subject HAS RELATIONSHIP WITH Object (3)". Delimit
            multiple references with commas, e.g., "(3, 4)".
            Do not include newlines.
            For each relationship, include the exact full sentence describing the
            relationship from the source text in pipe symbols after the
            references, e.g. "(3) |Vitamin D deficiency causes rickets|."
            Do not change or summarize the sentence.
            If the relationship is described in multiple sentences,
            create a separate, pipe delimited entry for each sentence.

            between a single nutrient (including vitamins,
            minerals, and micronutrients) and a single
            biological process, with a type of relationship
            connecting them both. A biological process is an
            activity or series of activities that occur in a
            cell or organism, such as "nuclear axial expansion",
            "intracellular transport", "ribosomal subunit export from nucleus",
            "insulin signaling", or "DNA repair".
            Biological processes do NOT include health states such as
            "healthy teeth" or proteins such as "retinoic acid receptor".
            Represent the relationship as triples, e.g.,
            "Nutrient HAS RELATIONSHIP WITH Process". Relationships may include
            REGULATES, PARTICIPATES IN, or others.
            If the relationship is explicitly negated, precede the
            relationship with "NOT", e.g., "NOT Nutrient HAS RELATIONSHIP
            WITH Process".
            For each relationship, include the number of the
            corresponding reference(s) in parentheses after the
            relationship; e.g., if the text indicates a reference

            relationship from the source text in pipe symbols after the
            references, e.g. "(3) |Vitamin D participates in the insulin
            signaling pathway|." Do not change or summarize the sentence.
            If the relationship is described in multiple sentences,
            create a separate, pipe delimited entry for each sentence.
      nutrient_to_health_status_relationships:

        multivalued: true
        description: >-

            minerals, and micronutrients) and a single
            part or system of the body, with a type of relationship
            connecting them both. Example parts or systems include
            "teeth", "skin", "cardiovascular system", "digestive system",
            or "liver". Transform names of processes
            to their respective anatomy, e.g., "thyroid function" or
            "thyroid health" should be changed to "thyroid"; "digestion"
            should be changed to "digestive system". Represent the
            relationship as triples, e.g., "Nutrient HAS RELATIONSHIP WITH
            Part". Relationships should be SUPPORTS HEALTH OF.
            If the relationship is explicitly negated, precede the
            relationship with "NOT", e.g., "NOT Nutrient HAS RELATIONSHIP
            WITH Part".
            For each relationship, include the number of the
            corresponding reference(s) in parentheses after the

            of (3), include it after the object in the relationship,

            references, e.g. "(3) |Vitamin D supports the health of the
            cardiovascular system.|" Do not change or summarize the sentence.
            If the relationship is described in multiple sentences,
            create a separate, pipe delimited entry for each sentence.

            Represent the relationship as triples, e.g., "Nutrient HAS
            RELATIONSHIP WITH Source". Relationships should be PROVIDED

            them both. This does not include relationships
            between nutrients and proteins (e.g., a nutrient
