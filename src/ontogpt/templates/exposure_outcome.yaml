  ExposureEventOutcomeCollection:
    description: A collection of exposure events and their associated outcomes.
    slots:
      - exposure_event
      - outcome
    annotations:
      prompt: >-
        A semi-colon separated list of chemical to disease relationships, where the relationship is either CAUSES
        or CONTRIBUTES_TO.
        for example: PM2.5 exposure CAUSES cardiac heart disease; 
        Methyldopa CAUSES Hypotension;
        Monosodium Glutamate CONTRIBUTES_TO Headache;
        Imatinib CAUSES cancer

  NamedThing:
    abstract: true
    description: A generic class for named entities. Often used to anchor identifiers and human-readable labels for ontology classes.
    slots:
      - id
      - name
  ExposureEvent:
    is_a: NamedThing
    description: >-
      A record of a toxicological exposure, usually representing a chemical or environmental factor 
      impacting an organism. Can be mapped to ontology concepts from ECTO.
    slots:
      - exposure_substance
      - exposure_type
      - concentration
      - duration
      - frequency
    exact_mappings:
      - biolink:ExposureEvent
  ChemicalEntity:
    is_a: NamedThing
    description: A chemical compound or drug used as a toxicant in an exposure study. Should ideally map to a CHEBI class.
    slots:
      - name
    exact_mappings:
      - biolink:ChemicalEntity
  Phenotype:
    is_a: NamedThing
    description: >-
      A phenotypic abnormality or observable feature resulting from a toxicant exposure. 
      Should be mapped to Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) where possible.
  Annotation:
    abstract: true
    description: Abstract class used to group annotation-like records, including quantitative values.
  QuantityValue:
    is_a: Annotation
    description: A measurement represented as a numeric value and an associated unit (e.g. 5 mg/L). Useful for concentration, frequency, and duration.
  Concentration:
    is_a: QuantityValue
    description: A numeric concentration (e.g. 3.5 Âµg/mL) of a toxicant used in an exposure.
  ExposureOutcomeEvent:
    description: >-
      A specific linkage between an exposure and the resulting phenotypes. 
      A document that contains exposure to outcome relations
    slots:
      - exposure_event
      - outcome
    annotations:
      prompt: >-
        A semi-colon separated list of chemical to disease relationships, where the relationship is either CAUSES
        or CONTRIBUTES_TO.
        for example: PM2.5 exposure CAUSES cardiac heart disease; 
        Methyldopa CAUSES Hypotension;
        Monosodium Glutamate CONTRIBUTES_TO Headache;
        Imatinib CAUSES cancer

slots:
  id:
    identifier: true
    range: uriorcurie
    description: A unique identifier for a concept or entity, typically a CURIE-formatted ontology ID.
  name:
    description: A human-readable label or preferred name for the entity. Often used in free text and should align with ontology term labels.
  exposure_type:
    description: The category of the exposure event, such as 'inhalation exposure to ozone'. Values should ideally map to ECTO ontology terms.
    range: ExposureTypeEnum
  has_unit:
    description: The unit associated with a quantity (e.g. mg/m^3, ppm). Use units that correspond to ontology-based unit systems when possible.
  has_numeric_value:
    description: The numeric value part of a measured quantity, such as 5.0 or 0.25.
  treated_with:
    description: The chemical used in the exposure, specified as an ontology URI or identifier (e.g. CHEBI or DrugBank).
    range: uriorcurie
  exposure_substance:
    description: The substance used in the exposure. Should map to a CHEBI identifier or drug ontology term.
    range: uriorcurie
  concentration:
    description: The concentration of the toxicant. Usually specified as a `Concentration` class instance.
  duration:
    description: The duration over which the exposure occurred. Expected as a `QuantityValue` with appropriate unit.
    range: QuantityValue
  exposure_event:
    description: The exposure event associated with the outcome. Use the `ExposureEvent` class to describe this.
    range: ExposureEvent
  outcome:
    description: A list of observed human phenotypes resulting from exposure. Values should align with HPO terms or free text convertible to such terms.
    range: Phenotype
    multivalued: true
  frequency:
    description: Frequency of the exposure, e.g., daily, weekly. Should be given as a `QuantityValue` where appropriate.
    range: QuantityValue
enums:
  ExposureTypeEnum:
    description: Enumeration of exposure types derived from the ECTO ontology. Free-text values should be mapped to ECTO subclasses of 'exposure event' where possible.
