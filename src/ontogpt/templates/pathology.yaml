# TODO: Tune the anatomy extraction; it seems to miss many instances
# TODO: Try to be more specific about SNOMED terms, e.g., hemosiderin deposition
# grounds to SNOMEDCT:70748002 but that's specific to "Hemosiderin measurement, urine"

    description: >-
      A semicolon-delimited list of statements, each describing a pathology,
      including any diagnoses, one or more specific qualities being measured
      and the anatomical location or tissue the pathology is measured in. Each
      statement should describe a single condition.

        description: >-
          A semicolon-delimited list of pathology statements, each describing a
          pathology, including any diagnoses, one or more specific qualities
          being measured and the anatomical location or tissue the pathology is
          measured in. If any of the pathology statements are negative, the
          negation should be included in each statment, e.g., "no granulomas or
          viropathic changes" should become "no granulomas" and "no viropathic
          changes".
        range: PathologyStatement
        multivalued: true

  PathologyStatement:
    description: >-
      A statement that describes a pathology, including any diagnoses,
      one or more specific qualities being measured and the anatomical
      location or tissue the pathology is measured in.
    attributes:
      diagnosis:
        description: >-
          The diagnosis or pathology being described, for example, "colitis",
          "inflammation", or "dysplasia". If not specified or cannot be
          identified (e.g., due to lack of tissue sample), this value must be
          "N/A".
        range: Diagnosis
        annotations:
          prompt.example: colitis, inflammation, dysplasia
      qualities:
        description: >-
          A semicolon-delimited list of properties being measured,
          or changes in this property, for example, severity,
          size, or color. If not specified, this value must be "N/A".
        range: Quality
        multivalued: true
      qualifiers:
        description: >-
          A semicolon-delimited list of descriptors other than those for
          severity. If not specified, this value must be "N/A".
        range: string
        annotations:
          prompt.example: active, chronic, focal
        multivalued: true
      severity:
        description: >-
          The severity of the pathology, for example, mild, moderate, or severe.
          If not specified, this value must be "N/A".
        range: string
        annotations:
          prompt.example: mild, moderate, severe
      anatomical_entities:
        description: >-
          Semicolon-delimited list of anatomical locations or tissues
          the pathology is measured in. This may need to be inferred from the
          text, for example, "colitis" means the entity should be "colon".
          If this is not specified or cannot be inferred then this value must
          be "N/A".
        range: AnatomicalEntity
        annotations:
          prompt.example: duodenum, colonic mucosa, liver
        multivalued: true
      negative:
        description: >-
          Whether the pathology is negative or not present. A statement of
          "no significant pathologic abnormality" or the short form "nspa"
          would have a value of true.
        range: string
        annotations:
