  Adult Refsum disease (ARD is associated with elevated plasma phytanic acid levels, late childhood-onset (or later) retinitis pigmentosa, 
  and variable combinations of anosmia, polyneuropathy, deafness, ataxia, and ichthyosis.
  Plasmapheresis or lipid apheresis to decrease phytanic acid levels is used only for acute arrhythmias or extreme weakness. 
  Dietary restriction of phytanic acid intake helps resolve ichthyosis, sensory neuropathy, and ataxia. A high-calorie diet 
  and avoidance of fasting prevent mobilization of phytanic acid stored in adipose tissue into the plasma. Hypercaloric parenteral 
  infusions are required during periods of severe illness or postoperatively. Supportive treatment includes hydrating creams for
  ichthyosis and drugs for cardiac arrhythmias and cardiomyopathy
