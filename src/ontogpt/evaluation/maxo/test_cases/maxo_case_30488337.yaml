  "Canaloplasty in the Treatment of Open-Angle Glaucoma: A Review of Patient Selection and Outcomes
  Canaloplasty is a relatively new non-penetrating surgery for the reduction of intraocular pressure 
  in patients affected by glaucoma. The technique uses a microcatheter to perform a 360 º cannulation of 
  Schlemm's canal and leaves in place a tension suture providing an inward distension. It aims to restore 
  the physiological outflow pathways of the aqueous humour and is independent of external wound healing
  Several studies have shown that canaloplasty is effective in reducing intraocular pressure and has a low rate 
  of complications, especially compared with trabeculectomy, the gold standard for glaucoma surgery. Currently, 
  canaloplasty is indicated in patients with open-angle glaucoma, having a mild to moderate disease, and the combination
  with cataract phacoemulsification may provide further intraocular pressure reduction."
