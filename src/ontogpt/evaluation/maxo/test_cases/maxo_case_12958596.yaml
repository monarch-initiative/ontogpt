  Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is a 'master molecule' in immunoglobulin (Ig) 
  class-switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM) generation, AID deficiencies are 
  associated with hyper-IgM phenotypes in humans and mice. We show here that recessive mutations of 
  the gene encoding uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) are associated with profound impairment in CSR at a 
  DNA precleavage step and with a partial disturbance of the SHM pattern in three patients with hyper-IgM 
  syndrome. Together with the finding that nuclear UNG expression was induced in activated B cells, 
  these data support a model of CSR and SHM in which AID deaminates cytosine into uracil in targeted DNA 
  (immunoglobulin switch or variable regions), followed by uracil removal by UNG.
