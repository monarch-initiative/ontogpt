  "McKusick-Kaufman Syndrome
  Clinical characteristics: McKusick-Kaufman syndrome (MKS) is characterized by
  the combination of postaxial polydactyly (PAP), congenital heart disease
  (CHD), and hydrometrocolpos (HMC) in females and genital malformations in
  males (most commonly hypospadias, cryptorchidism, and chordee). HMC in infants
  usually presents as a large cystic abdominal mass arising out of the pelvis,
  caused by dilatation of the vagina and uterus as a result of the accumulation
  of cervical secretions from maternal estrogen stimulation. HMC can be caused
  by failure of the distal third of the vagina to develop (vaginal agenesis),
  a transverse vaginal membrane, or an imperforate hymen. PAP is the presence of
  additional digits on the ulnar side of the hand and the fibular side of the
  foot. A variety of congenital heart defects have been reported including
  atrioventricular canal, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect,
  or a complex congenital heart malformation. Diagnosis/testing: The clinical
  diagnosis of MKS can be established in a proband based on clinical diagnostic
  criteria of HMC and PAP in the absence of clinical or molecular genetic
  findings suggestive of an alternative diagnosis. The molecular diagnosis can
  be established in proband with suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic
  variants in MKKS identified by molecular genetic testing. However, care must
  be taken to ensure that the proband does not have Bardet-Biedl syndrome, an
  allelic condition with considerable clinical overlap and age-dependent
  features including retinal dystrophy, obesity, and intellectual disability.
  Management: Treatment of manifestations: Surgical repair of the obstruction
  causing HMC and drainage of the accumulated fluid. Treatment for polydactyly
  and congenital heart defects and any other anomalies is standard."
